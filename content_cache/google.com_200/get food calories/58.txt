        <h3>Advising Notes</h3> 
        <ol> 
         <li>Students should contact the program coordinator to schedule an academic advising appointment each semester. Since many courses are sequential in nature, it is important for new, transfer, or returning students to contact the program coordinator one semester prior to intended enrollment.<strong><em> Note</em></strong>: A minimum&nbsp;2.3 GPA is required for on campus entry into the department options. </li> 
         <li>CR/NC grading is not permitted for courses included in the major and additional requirements, except work experience (FSC 193; FSM 193; and NUTR 193). </li> 
         <li>Grade Policy - all courses listed under major and additional requirements require a grade of C or better. </li> 
         <li>General Education courses designated as required by the department are prerequisite to many courses in the program of study. </li> 
         <li>The upper-division writing skills requirement can be met by passing the university upper-division writing examination or by passing an approved upper-division writing skills course. One unit of credit (in ENGL 100W) may be earned for passing the examination if requested by the student; by obtaining a letter grade of C or higher in an approved course (e.g., PLANT 110W) the student meets the university writing skills requirement. </li> 
         <li>For further information, see the Food Science and Nutrition Department Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) Student Handbook: <a href="http://www.fresnostate.edu/jcast/fsn/documents/faculty-staff/DPDHandbookS13-14Final.pdf">http://www.fresnostate.edu/jcast/fsn/documents/faculty-staff/DPDHandbookS13-14Final.pdf</a>. </li>
