      <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="li-comment-609097"> <p class="postmeta"><strong>thatonegeek</strong> </p> <p>it's a trade off. </p> <p>Firefox (as Waterfox x64 for me) is the only serious choice since any iteration of IE (or any frontend that uses the Trident engine) is an abominable joke from a professional tech point of view, and so is any chromium based browser due to the very serious violations of privacy &amp; security (with the exceptions of Iron &amp; Dragon which remove the dangerous rogue code that should be illegal - but there is only laughable extension support since the API is a silly joke of a mess)-- so that leaves us with the perennial 2nd browser -- Opera-- a true masterpiece if there ever was one.</p> <p>i've used it as a backup browser for about 15 years, but never a first until this last year. i enjoy it a lot since extensions are being developed that have actual functional use as opposed to being plain stupid as they use to be (much like how IE &amp; chromium still are)-- and it's a little easier on memory, but not much. it loads faster &amp; navigates better without the flaws of the two dangerous rogue browsers mentioned.</p> <p>but after a year of full time browsing with Opera, i see no appreciable reason to bump it up from number two for one primary reason: lack of security.</p> <p>the content blocking in Opera only removes it from view--- it does NOT prevent it from being downloaded the way Adblock Plus, NoScript &amp; Request Policy do together. it DOES have Ghostery, which is very very handy and much appreciated, but the API does not allow it to function the same as in Mozilla. there are a number of other extensions missing from Opera in the privacy &amp; security area as well as the UI that are missing that i miss &amp; insist on having in order to full time convert-- such as Grease Monkey, Tabmix Plus, FEBE, Disconnect, Better Privacy, ShareMeNot, Download Helper, CSlite, HTTPS Everywhere, Force TLS, etc--- </p> <p>--with that said, there are great Opera tweaks as well as extensions that mimic some of the best Mozilla ones, but they don't duplicate them-- and that is what keeps me from switching full on.</p> <p>it's a great backup browser, because of it's obvious superiority in many ways, but Mozilla still trumps it for me in the most critical areas. besides, i've got an uber cool gaming rig, so i really don't care about the Mozilla memory problems.</p> <p>there are trade-offs, but it's also about taste &amp; what you need. both platforms are great, and i think anyone would be missing out if they didn't have one of each to judge for themselves. both are pioneers &amp; have their obvious strengths.-- maybe try a triple engine browser to get the best of all of them in one?!</p> <p>by the way- thanks VG for having one of the best sites anywhere--- you are one cool, competent guy who is appreciated by a lot of people!</p> </li>

Tested install and portable versions, wifi and ethernet. On all other computers the speed is what it is supposed to be, so I'm baffled about this behaviour. Since the netbooks need a fast light and reliable browser, I now use Maxthon and SlimBrowser instead of Opera. If and when Maxthon ever gets adblock plus support, I will use it as my main browser on every computer. Opera is going in the wrong direction with their shiny new features nobody will ever use or need, they should just make a browser with nothing extra, just blazing speeeeeeeed =)</p> </li>

If there are, I cannot see them. I am using Opera 12.16 64bit. I was better off with the 32 Bit version because that seemed to be the most stable. But I am sure there are a few quirks. THE NEW Opera 20 and all of the Chromium based versions are truly a waste of time. I would get away from Opera because they are trying to use the same code as other well knowns who insist on injecting code that violates our privacy. Opera is getting greedy and the reason they may want to use chromium now is because they want to take advantage of the many ways they can make money as Google has done. The new browsers are a big disappointment and seems like they want to pull the wool over our eyes but I for one will not budge. Opera, you really blew it. And not many are falling for it.,</p> </li>

      <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-1862406"> <p class="postmeta"><strong>Frank</strong> </p> <p>It would sure be nice to see Opera 12's accessibility features return, and not buried in hidden settings. For years I have recommend Opera to my fellow cripples because it WAS the only browser on the market that took the effort to be accessible to us. ChrOpera, on the other hand, is now makes the Web just as inaccessible as every other browser out there.</p> <p>I tried to make Firefox work like Opera used to, but that just led to even more frustration because even after adding dozens of extensions it still couldn't do half of what Opera 12 does, and what it could do is either clunky or buried in hidden settings the average user could never find. My sanity finally demanded I go back to Opera 12 until HTML 5 finally takes over the Web and renders Opera no longer able to display Websites. I live in dread of that day since it will mean there will no longer be a browser for those of us with disabilities. After using Opera for 15 years, switching to anything else is going to be painful  literally.</p> </li>

It installed 28 (but thankfully did not overwrite 12.17). Frankly I found 28 so annoyingly different, such as how it displays Favorites, as to be unusable and uninstalled it. A shame.

They have basically trashed the major appeal of Opera....the lightness in comparison to Chrome and Firefox.

      <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-2412787"> <p class="postmeta"><strong>Clairvaux</strong> </p> <p>December 12, 2015</p> <p>I was a long-time user of the legacy version of Opera (and still am). The current generation is pleasing to the eye and blazingly fast, but it has, in my view, several unacceptable drawbacks (please correct me if I've missed some features) :</p> <p>1. No way to export bookmarks. No kidding ?!? So you can import, but not export ! This is a huge red flag. Il live on bookmarks. I have 10 000 of them. This is a blatant attempt to lock users into Opera's sync cloud "feature", which is not a feature to me, but a way to deprive me from the ownership of my data.</p> <p>I found a so-called extension purporting to correct this, but it cannot even save nested folders. What a joke ! Besides, I'm not going to rely on a third-party extension for such a critical task.</p> <p>2. No way to add tags or comments to bookmarks. Firefox invented that (I think) ages ago ! Absolutely needed if you're going to use bookmarks for something else than finding Facebook.</p> <p>3. No way to access bookmarks or history in one click. This is ridiculous.</p> <p>4. The user interface cannot be customized. At. All.</p> <p>5. Updates are forced on you, with no options such as "never update" or "warn me but let me choose". Oh, and automatic updating is shaky at best. This blog post says version 34 has been released, my Opera says "you have 33 and you're up to date".</p> <p>6. Online help (there's no other variety) is ridiculously scarce.</p> <p>Opera may be fine if you're the sort of user who just "browses the Web" and never does anything serious on the Internet -- never mind using it at work. Even for such limited use, it's lacking.</p> </li>

It came as surprise, as Opera supposedly stopped the development of Classic Opera browser. I'm a big fan of Presto based Classic Opera, I use it regularly; not as my primary browser though.</p> </li>

It doesn't work, guys. We have a jobs to do, we have no time to searching the internet for patches or solutions to make it work, ok? Opera does not do the basic thing - search the web.

      <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="li-comment-2687700"> <p class="postmeta"><strong>Bruce</strong> </p> <p>It's good to see some people still use Opera 12.17, as I do. But the past couple of weeks it keeps getting worse and worse. I also use Opera for mail and RSS feeds. Different types of security errors on more and more websites. Often Opera fails when accessing some websites or just viewing mail. I use it on Windows XP, but I loaded it on Windows 7 to see if it had same problems. It did. I tried Opera Mail when Opera came out without mail, but it didn't handle RSS feeds. The way things are I'm going to have to abandon it.<br> Anybody have similar problems and maybe resolved them?</p> </li>

Mine has been crashing often in at least the last three versions. Also, on Speed Dial, is there a way to combine folders, or create sub folders? I use Speed Dial extensively and I want to organize it similar to bookmarks structure.</p> </li>
