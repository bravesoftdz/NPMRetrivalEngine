   <a href="http://bitcoin-vs.s3.amazonaws.com/asic-bitcoin-mining-gear.html">asic bitcoin mining gear</a>Bitcoin is a push-based and single-use method of payment.
   <a href="http://bitcoin-vs.s3.amazonaws.com/bitcoins-kaufen-unter-18.html">bitcoins kaufen unter 18</a>This means your customer must take action to send the required amount of bitcoin to you.The pushing of funds may take a few minutes since your customer must do this outside of your checkout flow, but the amount is immediately available as soon as the funds have been received.

   <form action="" method="POST"> 
    <script checkout.js" class="stripe-button" data-key="pk_test_6pRNASCoBOKtIshFeQd4XMUh" data-amount="2000" data-name="Demo Site" data-description="2 widgets ($20.00)" data-image="/img/documentation/checkout/marketplace.png" data-label="Pay with Card or Bitcoin" data-locale="auto" data-currency="usd" data-bitcoin="true">  </script> 
   </form> After specifying the amount in USD that you want to receive, Stripe handles displaying the converted amount in BTC that your customer needs to pay.Once a Bitcoin payment is received, Checkout submits the form with the following extra fields: stripeToken: The ID of the chargeable Source object stripeTokenType: The type of token returned—the value is source_bitcoin stripeEmail: The email address provided by the customer You can then immediately make a charge request using the source.
