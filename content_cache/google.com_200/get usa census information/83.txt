      <br>Typescript copy of the autobiography, 1907, of St. George Tucker Brooke (1844-1914) of Richmond, Hanover and Stafford counties, Virginia.

An appendix at the end of the narrative contains transcripts of letters of commendation for military service and a letter from the Haw family who cared for Brooke when he was wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness.

Dibble (1844-1917) of Orangeburg, South Carolina, reminiscing about the battle of Drewery?s Bluff on 14-16 May 1864, and detailing his participation as a member of the 24th Virginia Cavalry in that fight. He comments on watching Dibble?s regiment, the 25th South Carolina, perform during the engagement. Broughton also offers a brief geographic and agricultural description of the Eastern Shore of Virginia. Broughton wrote Dibble after seeing an article in the October 1915 issue of the Confederate Veteran regarding the 25th South Carolina at Drewery?s Bluff. He did not know that Dibble had died years earlier.

      <strong>Accession 41980.</strong> 112 pages.
      <br>
      <br>Correspondence, 1861-1865, of the Campbell family of Delaware County, Indiana. Many of the letters were written to sisters Mary (b. ca. 1841) and Jane Campbell (b. ca. 1835) from their brothers, Lieutenant William H. Campbell (b. ca. 1837), and Corporal James M. Campbell (b. ca. 1839), both serving with the 19th Indiana Infantry Regiment in Virginia. A handful of letters from soldiers show that the sisters also acted as pen pals for other members of the regiment. Topics include a June 1862 suicide attempt made by another soldier of the 19th Indiana, recovery from wounds and illnesses, a skirmish-ridden march south into Virginia close behind Confederate troops in November 1862, predictions for upcoming battles including Fredericksburg in December 1862, news of romantic attachments, and the reluctance to part from friends in the regiment at the war?s end.

      <br>Letters, 1864-1865, of William Boyd Compton (1838-1898) of Marion County, West Virginia, to his fiancee Kate Kerr (1844-1920) also of Fairmont, Marion County. The subject of the letters includes personal news and war news, including discussion of the closing months of the Civil War, the end of the 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign, the siege of Petersburg and the death of General John Pegram (1832-1865), Compton?s trip behind Union army lines to Highland County, his belief that the Confederacy would still gain its independence, and his intentions to travel south and fight until the last gun. Letters also describe Compton?s efforts to relocate and pursue a career as a lawyer and deciding on Harrisonburg, Virginia. Compton also attempts to arrange a date and location for his wedding to Kate Kerr, stating that his reputation might prevent them from marrying in West Virginia, where she resides, but finally adding that he has received a special pardon from the President of the United States, Andrew Johnson (1808-1875), which allays his concerns. Compton mentions his cousin the Confederate spy Belle Boyd (1844-1900).

Prisoners either ask for needed supplies or acknowledge receipt of the goods sent them by Egerton, often include detailed and itemized descriptions of the requested or received goods, including clothes size, food items, and missing items. Most of the letters come from prisoners at Fort Delaware, Fort McHenry, Point Lookout, and Johnson's Island; some letters are from members of the Immortal 600 while in Georgia and South Carolina and one letter is from a prisoner at Rock Island Prison. Letters also contain information concerning the prisoners' medical condition and care, rank and unit, point of capture, period of captivity, and family members. Post-war letters from destitute men and women throughout the South requesting or acknowledging receipt of goods and including personal accounts of the general state of economics in the South.

Gookin then notes that Bragg has been replaced by General Joseph E. Johnston. Gookin also describe his trip home to Bristoe Station in Prince William County, Virginia, before his enlistment.

      <strong>Accession 20462.</strong> 2 leaves. Photostats (negative).
      <br>
      <br>Letter, 12 September 1863, from Cornelia Grinnan (1821-1864) of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, to George Douglas Campbell, Duke of Argyll (1823-1900) introducing to the Duke Dr. Albert Taylor Bledsoe (1809-1877) who is travelling to London, England on a mission for Confederate President Jefferson Davis (1808-1889). Grinnan also details the difficulties of civilian life around Fredericksburg, Virginia, after the battles there and at Chancellorsville, Virginia, in late 1862 and early 1863. She comments on Union cavalry raids in the area and the distruction of personal property. Grinnan states that despite reports in Northern newspapers, inhabitants are unable to get supplies from the Union army unless they take the oath of allegiance. A note on this photostatic copy indicates the letter was never delivered to the duke, and that the original was in possession of the Bledsoe family at the time it was lent for copying.

      <br>Message, 9 February 1864, of Robert E. Lee commenting on the actions of the general officers involved in the attack on New Bern, North Carolina. This appears to be a covering endorsement of a report filed by Major General George E. Pickett; however, his report, as printed, is 15 February 1864. The endorsement has been located only in Douglas S. Freeman?s ?Lee?s Dispatches....? Freeman cites the source as ?the private collection of Wymberley Jones De Renne of Wormsloe, Georgia,? but it was not included in the part of that collection which was presented to the library by Bernard Baruch.

      <br>Journal, 1864-1865, of Charles E. Lining, Past Assistant Surgeon, CSN, kept during the entire cruise of the Shenandoah.

The statements regarding the discussion as to the disposition of the ship are of special interest, as are the ones on the threatening interning of the Shenandoah at Melbourne. James I. Waddell (1824-1886) was the Lieutenant Commanding, of the CSS Shenandoah. Journal includes a list of the crew at the beginning and at the end of the volume.

      <br>
      <br>Montgomery County, Virginia, Marriage Register, 1850-1861, is the first section of a volume dedicated to two different record types. This register is a list of marriage licenses issued by the county court clerk. For the most part, this section follows a chronological arrangement. The listings indicate the day, month and year when the license was issued as well as the full names of both parties. Second section, 1862-1865, records expense accounts from a local retail firm of James E. Crush and James M. Wade, better known as ?Crush and Wade.? Accounts indicate that the business dealt to some degree with the military--grinding and polishing sabers and polishing dress swords. Also included in this volume is an inventory for a finishing shop and individual customer accounts. Unlike the first section, found on Microfilm Reel 52, this section was not microfilmed. There are some loose accounts , 1862-1864, found in the volume but not recorded in its pages.

      <strong>Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia.</strong> Declarations and revaluations of assurance, 1796-1966.
      <br>
      <strong>Accession 30177.</strong> 281 volumes and 24 reels.
      <br>
      <br>These records consist of 259 volumes of individual applications- called declarations and revaluations of assurance- dating from 1796 to 1966. Each printed form is numbered and is designated as a new policy or a revaluation. Policies include the name of the insured, place of residence, location of the insured property (with references to contiguous property), the name of the occupant of the property, a description and estimated value of each structure insured, and the date and the signature of the insured. An appraiser's statement regarding the value of the property is also included on each policy. At the bottom of each policy appears a sketch of the insured property. In most instances the sketches are rough outlines of the buildings as if viewed from above. The roofing material and distance from streets and from other structures are also noted. Agents sketched and compiled structural details about many of the great houses owned by Virginia's wealthy planters and entrepreneurs, but they also documented modest cottages, urban slave-quarters, and a variety of rural and urban outbuildings. Revaluations of insured property were required every seven years (or whenever additions were made to a policy), so succeeding declarations often showed additions to the original building, new outbuildings, and new uses for old buildings.
