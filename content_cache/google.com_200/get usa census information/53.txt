        <h4><span style="color: #800000;">Haydens Note:</span></h4> 
        <p><strong><em>I know this is a lengthy post, but it is incredibly educational.&nbsp; If nothing else, please scroll down towards the bottom and read the last several paragraphs that detail my plan of attack [To all IRS/DHS listening, that means non-violent response]&nbsp;when my Census Form arrives.&nbsp; Print it out and use it as a template for yourself!</em></strong></p> 
        <p>I recently heard someone say the time has come for some civil disobedience and the intrusive nature of the Census makes it the perfect place to start.&nbsp; I could not agree more. The American people need to draw a line in the sand and tell the reprobates in the federal government we will no longer tolerate their usurpations of power.</p> 
        <p>If the American people are going to make a stand and go toe to toe with the federal government, then they need a basic understanding of some constitutional principles because these principles are universal and pertain to every power exercised by the federal government.</p> 
        <p><strong>Constitutional Principles</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>Principle No. 1.</strong> The Constitution established a separation of power between the States and their federal government.&nbsp; James Madison explained this principle in Federalist Essay No. 45:</p>

        <blockquote>
         <p><em>The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined.&nbsp; Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.&nbsp; The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected.&nbsp; The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.</em></p> 
         <p><em>The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State governments in times of peace and security.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>In the New York State Convention debating ratification of the proposed constitution in 1788, John Jay, who was one of the authors of the Federalist Essays and would later become a justice of the United States Supreme Court, expressed this principle as follows:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>What are the objects of our state legislatures?&nbsp; Innumerable things of small moment occupy their attention; matters of a private nature, which require much minute and local information.&nbsp; The objects of the general government are not of this nature.&nbsp; They comprehend the interests of the states in relation to each other, and in relation to foreign nations.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>Thomas Jefferson discussed this principle in various writings throughout his political career.&nbsp; In 1816 he wrote:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>The way to have good and safe government is not to trust it all to one, but to divide it&nbsp; Let the national government be entrusted with the defense of the nation, and its foreign and federal relations; the state governments with the civil rights, laws, police, and administration of what concerns the state generally</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>The best key for the solution of questions of power between our governments is the fact that every foreign and federal power is given to the federal government, and to the states every power purely domestic. *&nbsp; * * The federal is, in truth, our foreign government</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The federal government was empowered to deal with foreign affairs and relations between the States while the States would concern themselves with domestic affairs.</p> 
        <p>The powers of the federal government are commonly known as <em>delegated powers</em> because when that government was established, the States delegated, not surrendered, a portion of their sovereign powers to the federal government.&nbsp; The powers not delegated to the federal government are known as <em>reserved powers</em>.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p> 
        <p><strong>Principle No. 2. </strong>The Constitution established a federal government of limited enumerated powers.&nbsp; Under this system of government, every power not granted to the federal government and enumerated in the Constitution is denied.&nbsp; This principle is the foundation of the Constitution and exists independent of the Tenth Amendment.&nbsp; That Amendment is merely a secondary level of restraint on the powers of the federal government.</p> 
        <p>In Federalist Essay No. 14, James Madison wrote that adoption of the proposed constitution would not grant the federal government general legislative authority throughout the United States:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>[I]t is to be remembered that the general government is not to be charged with the whole power of making and administering laws.&nbsp; Its jurisdiction is limited to certain enumerated objects</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>Alexander Hamilton addressed the principle of limited government in Federalist Essay No. 83:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>The plan of the convention declares that the power of Congressshall extend to certain enumerated cases.&nbsp; This specification of particulars evidently excludes all pretension to a general legislative authority, because an affirmative grant of special powers would be absurd, as well as useless, if a general authority was intended.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The federal government only exists within the sphere of its delegated powers and is constitutionally powerless to act absent a specific grant of power.&nbsp; It should be noted that there are no implied powers beyond the delegated powers.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; Congress has been granted the power to establish post offices.&nbsp; Therefore, Congress can pass any law necessary to the establishment and maintenance of post offices.&nbsp; This would include such incidental powers such as printing stamps, affixing their value, appropriating money for postal trucks, etc.</p> 
        <p>Members of Congress constantly attempt to reverse this principle.&nbsp; I have lost count of the number of times I have watched one of these clowns hold up a copy of the Constitution and claim their powers are unlimited except in those instances were the Constitution places a restriction on their power.&nbsp; These individuals are either corrupt, incompetent, or both.</p> 
        <p><strong>Principle No. 3.</strong> Constitutionally, the federal government cannot use its delegated powers to encroach on the powers reserved to the States.&nbsp; In other words, the federal government cannot convert its federal and foreign powers into domestic powers to do things not entrusted to that government, i.e., use principle No. 2 to circumvent principle No. 1.</p> 
        <p><strong>Constitutional Provisions for the Census</strong></p> 
        <p>The provision for the Census is found in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution.&nbsp; It is confined to determining the number of Representatives [in the House] and imposing direct Taxes among the several States.</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Number&nbsp; The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The reader will note the power to make laws concerning the Census is restricted to the actual enumeration.</p> 
        <p>In the case of direct taxes (a direct tax is a tax on property based on ownership), this provision requires Congress to apportion the tax among the individual States based on population.&nbsp; For example.&nbsp; Lets say in 1790, two years after the ratification of the Constitution, Congress prepared a budget and decided to impose a direct tax to raise the needed revenue.&nbsp; And, based on the Census, Virginia had 30% of the population of the United States.&nbsp; Under the rule of apportionment, Virginia would have been responsible for 30% of the tax.&nbsp; The States collect the tax and turn the money over to the federal government.</p> 
        <p>Direct taxes are inherently unfair because one State, with ten percent of the population, might be one of the richest States while another State, with the same percentage of the population, might be one of the poorest.&nbsp; Yet, under the direct tax formula imposed by the Constitution, both States would be required to pay the same amount.&nbsp; The Founders feared the use of direct taxes so they created a system to discourage their use.</p> 
        <p>Since direct taxes must be apportioned based on population, an enumeration is needed to determine the percentage of tax for each State.</p> 
        <p><strong>The Federal Government Distorts the Purpose of the Census</strong></p> 
        <p>On their web-page, the Census Bureau explains the purpose of the Census as follows:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 2) mandates a headcount of everyone residing in the United States.&nbsp; The population totals determine each states Congressional representation.&nbsp; The numbers also affect funding in your community and help inform decision makers about how your community is changing.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The reader will note that the federal governments statement of purpose does not comport with the Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution.&nbsp; Since decisions about our communities are not within the class of powers granted to the federal government (see constitutional principle No. 1), the reader will not find a reference to it in the limited powers granted to the federal government (see constitutional principle No. 2).</p> 
        <p><strong>No More Census Long Forms</strong></p> 
        <p>On their web-page, the Census Bureau states the long form used in the past has been replaced with a new short form:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>In the past, most households received a short-form questionnaire, while one household in six received a long form that contained additional questions and provided more detailed socioeconomic information about the population.</em></p> 
         <p><em>The 2010 Census will be a </em><em>short-form only census and will count all residents living in the United States as well as ask for name, sex, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity, relationship and housing tenure  taking just minutes to complete.</em></p> 
         <p><em>The more detailed socioeconomic information is now collected through the American Community Survey. The survey provides current data about your community every year, rather than once every 10 years. It is sent to a small percentage of the population on a rotating basis throughout the decade. No household will receive the survey more often than once every five years.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The reader will note that the additional information requested on the 2010 form will have absolutely nothing to with apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives.</p> 
        <p><strong>The American Community Survey</strong></p> 
        <p>As stated above, the Census Bureau will be using the American Community Survey to extract personal data that it previously received on the old long form.&nbsp; Once again, this information will have absolutely nothing to with apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives.</p> 
        <p><strong>Authority for the Census and the American Community Survey</strong></p> 
        <p>On their web-site, the Census Bureau claims the American people are required by law to provide the information requested on either form and our response is mandatory.</p> 
        <p>For the Census, they cite the provision of the Constitution referenced above as their authority to request the information.</p> 
        <p>For the American Community Survey, they cite Title 13, United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 141 and 193 as their authority to request the information.</p>

        <blockquote>
         <p>Section 141 (d) states, in part:<em> the Secretary, in the year 1985 and every 10 years thereafter, shall conduct a mid-decade census of population in such form and content as he may determine</em></p> 
         <p>Section 141 (e) (2) states: <em>Information obtained in any mid-decade census shall not be used for apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, nor shall such information be used in prescribing congressional districts.</em></p> 
         <p>Section 141 (g) <em>As used in this section, census of population means a census of population, housing, and matters relating to population and housing.</em></p> 
         <p>Section 193 states: <em>In advance of, in conjunction with, or after the taking of each census provided for by this chapter, the Secretary may make surveys and collect such preliminary and supplementary statistics related to the main topic of the census as are necessary to the initiation, taking, or completion thereof.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>The first thing reader should note is the difference between the statement of authority for the 2 surveys.&nbsp; The Census falls under the Constitution while the American Community Survey is merely based on a statute passed by Congress.</p> 
        <p>The second thing the reader should note concerning section 141 is the reference to <em>a mid-decade census</em> of population.&nbsp; There is no constitutional authority for mid-decade census.&nbsp; See again Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution.</p> 
        <p>The third thing the reader should note concerning section 141 is the statement that the information obtained from the mid-decade census cannot be used for the constitutional purpose of the actual Census.</p> 
        <p>The fourth thing the reader should note concerning section 141 is the statement that the mid-decade census is being used for <em>housing, and matters relating to population and housing.</em> Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 does not contain a grant of power concerning these subjects.</p> 
        <p>This takes us to the other section cited as the authority for the American Community Survey.&nbsp; Section 193 restricts census surveys and the collection of <em>preliminary and supplementary statisticsto the main topic of the censusnecessary to the initiation, taking, or completion thereof.</em> Constitutionally, the only <em>topic</em> of a census is a head count for apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 does not contain a grant of power for any other census.&nbsp; The other ones referenced in section 193 fail to meet the constitutional <em>topic</em> of the only census enumerated in the Constitution.</p> 
        <p>Note: See again the first 2 constitutional principles discussed at the beginning of this article and then apply them to the American Community Survey.</p> 
        <p><strong>Penalty Provisions for Failure to Comply with Either Survey Request</strong></p> 
        <p>On their web-site, the Census Bureau states the penalty provision for failing to comply with either survey request is found in Title 13, U.S.C., Section 221.</p> 
        <p>Pursuant to this section, refusing to provide the requested information or neglecting to complete either survey subjects you to a fine of not more than $100.00.&nbsp; Willfully giving information that is false subjects you to a fine of not more than $500.00.</p> 
        <p>Then, in what I believe is a blatant attempt to misrepresent federal law and install fear in the hearts and minds of the American people so they will provide the requested information, the Census Bureau included the following statement after their reference to the section 221 penalties referenced above:</p> 
        <blockquote>
         <p><em>Title 18 U.S.C. Section 3571 and Section 3559, in effect amends Title 13 U.S.C. Section 221 by changing the fine for anyone over 18 years old who refuses or willfully neglects to complete the questionnaire or answer questions posed by census takers from a fine of not more than $100 to not more than $5,000.</em></p>
        </blockquote> 
        <p>A review of Title 18 shows it is entitled:CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.</p> 
        <p>Section 3559 is entitled: Sentencing classification of offenses.&nbsp; Section (a) states: Classification.An offense that is not specifically classified by a letter grade in the section defining it, is classified if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is(9) five days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized, as an infraction.</p> 
        <p>Section 3571 is entitled: Sentence of fine.&nbsp; Section (a) states: A defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to pay a fine.&nbsp; Section (b) states in part: an individual who has been found guilty of an offense may be fined not more than the greatest of(7)for an infraction, not more than $5,000.&nbsp; This is the only reference to a fine in the amount cited by the Census Bureau that matches the provision in section 3559 above.</p> 
        <p>The $5,000.00 fine referenced in section 3571 is a post conviction fine that only applies to an individual who has been charged and convicted of a criminal infraction as defined in section 3559.&nbsp; Unless an individual has been charged and convicted of some criminal offense connected to the Census and the crime is classified as an infraction, this $5,000.00 fine does not apply.&nbsp; Thus, their assertion that these sections changed the fines in section 221 to $5,000.00 isyou fill in the blank.&nbsp; In my mind, its a blatant lie that borders on fraud.</p> 
        <p><strong>My Rules and Plan of Attack</strong></p> 
        <p>Here are the 3 basic rules I follow when I receive requests for personal information on the Census and/or American Community Survey forms.</p> 
        <p>* I never destroy or deface the forms.</p> 
        <p>* I never put false information on the forms.</p> 
        <p>* I never partially complete the forms.&nbsp; If I am going to make the assertion that the requested information does not apply to me or the requested information exceeds the governments constitutional authority to request the information, I return the form with a cover letter explaining why.</p> 
        <h2>Here is my plan of attack for the Census and American Community Survey forms.</h2> 
        <p>When I receive the 2010 Census form I will return it with a cover letter.&nbsp; In the letter I will give them the number of people residing in the house and state that pursuant to Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution that is the only information they are empowered to request.&nbsp; My name, sex, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity, telephone number, relationship and housing tenure have absolutely nothing to with apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives.&nbsp; Therefore, neither Congress nor the Census Bureau has the constitutional authority to make that information request a component of the enumeration outlined in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3.&nbsp; In addition, I cannot be subject to a fine for basing my conduct on the Constitution because that document trumps laws passed by Congress.&nbsp; Period end of story.</p> 
        <p>When I receive the American Community Survey form, I will return it with a cover letter.&nbsp; The letter will simply state that since the Constitution established a federal government of limited enumerated powers and that document does not grant them the general power to request the information, I am under no constitutional obligation to provide it.</p> 
        <p>If they attempt to distort the law and threaten me with the bogus $5,000.00 fine, as discussed and exposed above, I will send a letter to the Justice Department and request prosecution of the individuals making the threat.</p> 
        <p><strong>The Coup de Gras to their Unconstitutional Information Requests</strong></p> 
        <p>Even though I do not like to cite court cases, I&nbsp;will attach this one to my letter or hold it in reserve to support my refusal to comply with their bogus requests because it usually ends the discussion and any threat of a fine.</p>

        <p>If the federal government had been granted the general power to make inquires into the private affairs of the American people through the Census or a congressional mandated survey, then the Supreme Court could not have made this statement.</p>

               <p>I was harrassed constantly once this article went viral. I had supervisors on my porch every morning. I had random vehicles blocking my driveway (I lived 12 miles from town, it wasnt like downtown traffic with merely inconsiderate drivers  it was a long dirt road!). </p> 
               <p>When it first started, I would sleepily answer the door in my pajamas. After several days of this nonsense with a new person each time, I started answering the door with less and less clothing. It was an amusing experiment to say the least, but the supervisors and I argued several times and I received numerous empty threats of fines, penalties, Its the law! and more. Each time, I referred to the article above and the letter that was sent when I received my initial census survey.</p> 
               <p>I had the Census Bureau on this website daily but nothing ever came of it. If I can have an article that went as viral as this one did and they still didnt fine me or imprison me, I think if you stand your ground with confidence, theyll back off of you, as well. Good luck and let me know if I can be of any assistance!</p> 
               <p>PS  the case law cited in the Census letter could very well apply to the TSA right now. Im doing more research, but they ARE purely an administrative body</p>

               <p>When this was initially posted, it was in response to the Census and American Community Survey. I included the letter at the very bottom WITH my Census forms and mailed it right back to them using the provided return mailer. It was a seperate sheet that I merely printed, as is. Of course, I answered the initial and only relevant, legal question: How many people reside at this address? When I began to get harrassed, I explained to several of the workers who claimed I never returned my form, that not only did I mail it back  but I returned it promptly AND included a letter. I then gave them a copy of the letter, as well. It was almost humorous as they would continually return with new workers and supervisors.</p> 
               <p>What are they doing to harass you? Calls? In person? And I assume youre referring to the American Community Survey? Hope to hear back from you!</p>

             <p>Well, my name is not Connie, that is the name of the worker for ACS who has visited me 4 times now,(my phone is not published), so I jumped right to the visits. She still hasnt figured out that I have a camera pointed at the doors. I play my music very loud, and sometimes I think she even likes it. She is a music teacher at the local community college after all. Since shes 56 years old I play ABBA and Air Supply for her. I sure enjoy watching her get frustrated, I even recorded her calling us, jerks, for not answering the door. Funny thing is that when I looked up her name in the phone book the number was listed under her husbands name, Bruce. I even typed in the address in Google and it showed the house from the street. If I can find out that info, than the government can too, and they dont have to waste all that paper to do it, not to mention paying these people to do it. Oh yeah, the job Connie has is supposed to go to people who dont have a job, isnt it? If she already works than the administration cant include that in their created or saved jobs stats, can they? Now, on the form is a small paragraph that says something about the if number of the form is expired than I dont have to fill it out. Well the forms they sent me were both expired according to their websight. If it is true that I dont have to fill it out then why the hell are they coming to my door? I wonder if the CB is actually using the information on these forms that are exprired. Also, since they came around and GPSd my front door, then they know my address and therefore my name. I noticed a pretty barcode on the form. If that barcode is attached to my GPSd front door, then the Government can get my name and blah, blah, blah. All we can do is complain, there is no recourse for us. Push enough people and maybe piss some off, but mostly scare a great many people into submission. Anyway, my dog likes to bark, I sure pray the ACS workers dont jump the fence! I would hate to have to clean up the mess. I would also hate to have to explain to her congregation at the Episcapol (sp) church she attends why the only thing in the collection plate from Connie is a chewed up ACS form.</p>

             <p>I received the 2011 ACS and declined to answer. I have now had a total of four visits from Census workers, the last one today who was a supervisor. On the first visit, the worker left her business card and a letter advising that the ACS was mandatory and to hold it for her so that she could FedEx it to the regional processing office. The second visit I WAS home (2-9-11), answered the door and advised her that we did not wish to participate and her immediate reply was Its required by law and you will be fined if you dont answer. I advised her to leave and not return. However, she DID return yesterday, 2-11-11. I again advised her that we would not participate and handed her the following:</p> 
             <p>I hereby rebut your Title 13, Section 141 presumption of authority for personal information collection for Census 2010 and/or the American Community Survey, due to the following apparent Title 13 violations:<br>  §6(c) restrictions on process;<br>  §195 restrictions on Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 &amp; Amendment 14, Section 2 process;<br>  §241 failure of request process;<br>  §301(a), §303 &amp; §307 lack of authorization to collect information;<br>  §302 lack of authorization for Chapter 5 or Chapter 7 implementing regulations;<br>  And, your apparent personal violation of Chapter 1, Subchapter II, §23(c) restrictions on presumptions of Chapter 9 authority.<br>  THEREFORE: I hereby retain of all of my rights and privileges under the 4th and 5th Amendments, and respectfully decline to respond to any questions. </p> 
             <p>She immediately advised that I was in non-compliance and could be fined up to $5000 and that the matter would be referred to her supervisor. </p> 
             <p>Today, 2-12-11, a supervisor showed up (male, did not get his name or business card) I again told him we did not wish to participate  his response, and I quote You know you can be fined $5000!. I reiterated that we did not wish to participate, and his immediate response was Fine. Ill mark you down as non-compliant and let the Feds handle it..</p> 
             <p>I have had enough. Let them send the Justice Dept. after me. Someone has to stand up tho this incessant bullying</p>

               <p>Absolutely brilliant. I wish you the best and commend your efforts to be one of those who stand up against the machine. The fear mongering from Census personnel is overwhelming. Unbelievable, really. But, as theyll say, Im just doing my job! Well, back in the 1600 and 1700s, someone paid the executioner, too. </p> 
               <p>He was just doing his job.</p>

                     <p>I am with you. &nbsp;They came by late Saturday evening. &nbsp;Dressed very well, clean-cut, well-spoken young man from Denver. &nbsp;Real nice new car too. &nbsp;I told him how many people were in this residence. &nbsp;He stated that he would just fill out the survey for me and if there were any questions I find objectionable, we would address those at that time. &nbsp;I kindly told him that I find the survey violates my constitutional rights and find them obtrusive into my private life. &nbsp;Again, I will not answer any further questions. &nbsp;He explained how Mayors of these little towns appreciate this information so they can build schools and fire stations. &nbsp;I told him that neither are decided by Federal questionaires but by the municaplities themselves. &nbsp;I stop myself at that point and told him that I know he has had others probably tell him this and I would not be arguing the facts with him. &nbsp;He told me he appreciated my courtesy and got into his vehicle. &nbsp;He stayed in this vehicle, parked in my driveway, for another 20 minutes. &nbsp;I went out to ask if he had car trouble and he stated that he was simply reporting to his supervisor via laptop. &nbsp;I gave him a caopy of the letter mentioned in your blog and he said he would take this into the office but he could not guarantee that nobody else would be coming out to get these questions answered. &nbsp;He left after another 3 minutes in the driveway. &nbsp;I will keep you posted. &nbsp;Thanks again for all your help AND everyone who has responded with their thoughts.</p>

                       <p>Want to know what they are doing sitting out in their car in front of your house with their laptop? Check your security log on your port via firewall tab. You will get a printout of times that your security settings have been changed. Via remote, they are getting into your computer through the back door real time. Once they have the code, they can tap into your computer from their homes at night or any timeas many times as theyd like to view all that you do on internet. Our security settings havent been changed in 7 years. Then, since CB visits, they have been changed several times throughout the weeksup to 20 times on certain days. When they try to tap in when you are not on computer, it will say error along with date and time. This is definitely CRIMINAL, and a lawyer is on the trail.</p>

             <p>Hello,<br> Big Brother came into my livingroom two months ago in the form of The American Community Survey. I am appalled at the questions, such as How did this person get to work LAST WEEK? (ACS caps not mine) How many people, including this person, usually rode to work in the car, truck or van LAST WEEK? What time did this person usually leave home to go to work LAST WEEK? How many minutes did it usually take this person to get from home to work LAST WEEK? There are questions regarding how much you earn, what you pay for utilities, what utilities you use, how many bathrooms, bedrooms, age of house, etc. you have.<br> I called the ACS and talked to a woman there. She informed me that any letter I would send with the survey would be ignored. The only thing they do with the survey is to scan the answers so letters are, I guess, filed in a trash can. She also told me that I did not have to put my name on it rather just Head of household or Lady of household. I inquired about the survey. I informed her that I didnt believe, under the constitiution of the USA that I needed to answer any questions. She responded that I could put the letter R in each square if I had reasons that I did not feel comfortable answering this survey.<br> Thought you would like to know. Thank you for your information. It has been very helpful and I have copied the letter for it may be needed someday.<br> Blessings to you</p>

             <p>Forgot to mentionWe have had numerous phone calls but have not been home to answer them. Today which is Saturday, February 12th, 2011, a call came in from 1-520-798-4152 which my caller ID identified as Tucson, Arizona and not US Census Bureau. The woman wanted me to answer the questions over the phone. How handy for someone who was possibly trying to use this gimick for identity theft. I acknowledged that I had received the survey but that I would not answer it. Certainly not over the phone! I am mailing it back with R in most every white box and area to write in. The way it is worded I have no choice but to blanket R it.<br> The Justice department has hired the US Census Bureau to work for them and get the answers. Like Ron Paul says, None of Your Business. 250,000 surveys are sent out each month and the plan is that in 10 years every household will have had one! That is what I was informed of by a worker when I called the first time 2 months ago. Although it was started in the Bush administration, I believe the ground work for this was laid down prior to his Administration. I do not trust any government that wants to know when its citizens go to work, how long it takes to get there. I love the American people and we need to stand up against more of our fundamental rights being stolen by the few.</p>

             <p>Just found your website. Thank you. When I received the Census forms, all I gave was the number of people who lived at the address as that is all they can legally gather information on. I was called and then visited several times. The lady finally caught one of my kids and asked them questions! How dare they use such tactics! Now I have received my American Community Survey. I suspect it was related to my previous non-answering of the Census forms. When I read the questions, I was immediately enraged at the personal nature and information gathered. The Constitution guarantees a right to privacy for a reason! I will not be filling out my form and submitting it. Not sure where it will end, but Im sure it will be a journey. </p>

             <p>I love the Census! Really I do. The Census through the Decennial and the ACS collect the major source of info that Congress uses to justify laws. If they have poor info because people dont fill it out, then the Govt will act blindly. I want my govt to have the best data possible on our health, wealth and property, so that we really know what real people live like. As far as the authority granted in the Const. whats wrong with in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. They directed the ACS by LAW.</p>

             <p>David Higgins must work for the CB; in case you havent heard Mr. Higgins, our govt has been acting blindly and deaf for years.<br> Its interesting reading that so many are protesting and refusing to give this unbelievable request for personal information. I know several people who are going thru the same thing. Calls and door bell ringing by these lap dogs for the govt. From what Ive heard, some of the questions are extremely personal and should not be in anyones hands. Why would anyone give the details of their life when computer hackers can access govt computers, and people of questionable backgrounds accessing this information at the CB, We have a right to privacy and its being invaded by a govt bureau that has no power to fine or arrest anyone. This form should be voluntary. All census forms should be voluntary. And there should be no threats to any citizen of this country. This is bordering on a police state. Its time for the senators and representatives to stand up for their constituents and have this issue resolved immediately. No citizen should be harassed or threatened by anyone. Id consider this an unlawful search. There are laws against this.</p>

             <p>2/28/2011 A few weeks ago I received the dreaded community survey crap. Read it and I was appaled at what I was looking at. I put it down and ignored it. 2 days later a small post card arrived asking if I had received the form and telling me I had to fill it out and send it in. I likewise ignored it. Early last week I received another packet and this one had big bold letters on the envelope saying that it was the law to return it. I ignored it. Tonite about 8:50 the phone rang and sure enough it was big bro. I had dozed off and am not sure of the complete exchange. I do know that big bro (actually it was a woman). She was abrupt and I was indignant. I was informed that I would be sent another form even though I told her I wasnt interested in what she was selling. Bottom line Im sure its gonna start for me now. Guess I relating this to vent and Im scared. Im an old guy and raising a preteen by myself. I dont want to have anything happen to me. I dont know what this child would do. I am trying to get all of this info to use along with other stuff Ive read. Its kind of confusing to me. However I have decided to stand my ground no matter what. Its just the stress I know that Im going to endure that bothers me. Thanks for your in put though, I will sort it out and use it.</p>

             <p>I too just received the dreaded ACS. As a law-abiding citizen of the United States of America, I dutifully started filling the thing out. And as I went from question to question my uneasiness grew. I said to my husband, why would they care about how many rooms are in our home? What grade our children are in? What time I go to work and how I get there. I had to answer how well my 22 month old speaks and if my 7 year old has mental issues. Umm, nope. I dont think so. So I stopped filling it out, and started looking it up on the internet because I didnt believe that my government would REQUIRE me to fill out such a completely invasive survey. I figured it had to be a hoax, like the Nigerian prince asking for my bank account number so he can give me a million dollars. But no. no joke. I am supposed to fill this thing out or be threatened with fines that I can definitely not afford to pay.<br> I am early in the process, all of this just happened Saturday and I just today received the little postcard saying fill it out. I really dont want to deal with calls and visits. I am not a rebel rouser, I am a mother and wife and again, a law abiding citizen. But you know what? This is where my line is drawn. I refuse to give some anonymous mailbox the kind of information that they ask for on that form. Talk about making it easy to steal my identity or, with the times we leave for work, the knowledge someone could use to easily break into my home. Perhaps this makes me a bad citizen, because frankly, I dont care what they are using the information for. I dont care if it is to build new roads, create social programs etc. There has to be a better way to figure that stuff out. Like the little trucks that test emissions on the side of the road. Have one that counts the cars. Have a way to do this that is truly anonymous, cause a survey that includes your names, address, wages, childrens information, mortgage payment (I could go on and on) certainly is not.<br> And with that, Im off to craft my Im not doing it letter, although I have to wait to send it until they mail me another copy of the survey, since with good intentions, I did sit down and start to fill it out, and I am not sending even that much information now.<br> Wish me luck, and that I am one of the few that they give up on without home visits and phone calls. Im not counting on it, but Im hoping!</p>

             <p>The census workers have been harrassing us fairly often. I didnt fill out any of the surveys they sent, including the ACS. Then they came to my home at least 3 times. I explained to them that there were 2 people that lived here and that was all I would say. This was about 3 months ago. </p> 
             <p>Today at 6pm a woman comes to my home with a laptop and some forms. She wants me to tell her the answers I guess?! I told her I wasnt interested and she said by law I had to. I told her to go ahead and just fine me because Im not giving that kind of info to anyone especially, the goverment! </p> 
             <p>She reluctantly went away but Im sure this isnt the last time Ill have a census worker coming to my home, harrassing me.</p>

             <p>My wife filled out the census form and mailed it back to them, which I thought was the end. But no, now I received a letter stating I was randomly picked to fill out their survey. I was shocked at the questions they were asking and refused to send them any information. I feel this is intrusive and and invasion of ones privacy. </p> 
             <p>At this point in time I am at the stage of receiving the phone calls. Im glad I came upon this website to find other U.S. citizens taking a stand and fighting for their right to privacy.

             <p>Mr. Hayden,</p> 
             <p>I so appreciate your counsel to not fill out any part of the ACS, since we already submitted only the bare essentials (number of people in household) on the Census. However, you also highly commended Sherilyn Wood for her given advice by an ACS worker to put R in the response for the questions (I presume R stands for Refuse?). Would you please advise on which of the above you recommend more highly (no filling out answers at all OR putting R in the answer blanks?</p> 
             <p>We have not received any personal visits for the ACS, only the Census last year. However, we are receiving 2-3 calls per day. Only 2 messages were given for all the calls. Mostly, their ID is left on our caller ID. Thanks again!</p>

               <p>Thats a good question, Chuck. </p> 
               <p>I think putting anything, such as a small line or an R in the box shows that you didnt merely skip the question, but offered some form of response. Now, I would need to read over the ACS again, along with a few of the rules and regulations as I faintly recall something about marking up official documents. I know its a stretch, but anything that could lead to a rule violation or other absurdity should be avoided if possible.</p> 
               <p>However, my approach would be to leave it blank. I commend the R placed in the boxes, but cant attest to the compliance of that action.</p> 
               <p>Ill try and look over the regulations once more and offer my interpretation shortly. However, I am not a lawyer.</p>

             <p>I have a question about the wording of Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution (please see pasted below):<br> No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.</p> 
             <p>Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.</p> 
             <p>Our family still does not want to have this invasion of our privacy, but can someone help us interpret the above to conclude that the only information [the Census Bureau is] empowered to request is the total number of occupants at this address. Are we reading the correct part of the Constitution? We are not seeing total occupants in the above section. Can anyone out there help us find this? It does say, . . . in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.</p>

             <p>I recieved the ACS a couple weeks ago. At first I couldnt believe that it really was a Census Bureau requesting such invasive information. I spoke with several friends and today started looking on the internet and came across this wonderful site. This is the a horriffic invasion of personal privacy. I WILL NOT ANY WAY EVER ANSWER THIS THING. I have not started getting the harrassments said here but will deal with them as per the above advice and letter THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AMMUNITION. The comment above about has anyone contacted the ACLU,,, I have and all I got in return was a thank you for joining and please send us a donation. I called the Main office listed for ACLU here in my state and have gotten no answer nor response.. Apparently they dont care but do want the money. I am certainly forming a shortcut to this site and will print the letter and give it as my only response. What a bunch of Big Brother invasion and waste of our tax dollars. ;This could certainly be one area that needs to be disbanded by the Budget committee.</p>

             <p>Have you truly looked in to the ACS survey, you can do the survey anonymously. Read about it. The questions are designed to help the community. Such as asking military serviceso they know where veterans are most grouped enabling them to build much needed VA hospitals. How many children are in a home? Therefore letting the schools know what to anticipate in the coming years etc. Lack of knowledge is a dangerous thing.</p>

             <p>So is unquestioning, unwavering support for the system.</p> 
             <p>Secondly, this article  as the title implies  is centered around the Census and whether our Framers intended for it to be so far reaching. Yes, it applies to the ACS, as well, but more people comment on that due to it being continually sent out unlike the 10 year census.</p> 
             <p>I completely understand your point. Information is needed for community planning. Please dont think Im supporting this stance due to willful ignorance on my part. The point is standing up against the usurpation and assumption of power that is clearly not within the guidelines nor ideals of our Framers. Its in black and white.</p>

             <p>I have my cover letter and the American Community Survey ready to mail back. Should I include how many people reside at this address in my cover letter or answer that on the actual form?</p> 
             <p>Thank you for all your help on this illegal invasion of privacy. It was also interesting to find out that our personel data is being handed over to a private millitary contractor who thin subs it out to other companies.

             <p>Well, the American Community Survey is NOT the US Census. Congress provides for the 10-year counting of the population, not the annual advertisment and invasive survey known as the ACS. </p> 
             <p>If you do answer any questions, do so on the form and allow your cover letter to simply list the illegality, personal opinions, case law, etc. </p>

             <p>Just wanted to say that I am so glad I found your website! I got the dreaded ACS. I believe that many of these are targeted letters, directed at people such as those on disability or unemployment. Printed out your cover letter and am preparing to send it back with the survey and wait for the hellfire to start. I was also thinking of stating that they should just put me down as non-compliant right away and save Americas taxpayers from having to foot the bill for paying these CB workers. I believe I will. Getting out the chains and locks for the gates and hunkering down in our bunker. What has happened to our privacy and freedom? Why should we have to be scared in our own homes?</p>

             <p>We have been dealing with the ACS for several months now, getting two of the bulky questionnaires in the mail, followed up by numerous phone calls (and since this is supposedly by address and not you personally, what are they doing having our number and calling it?) where most times there is no message left, but you know its them by the lack of phone number and the out of area notification for caller ID. One time a woman did leave a partial message, saying it was the census bureau, then tried to back out of it, saying, Nope, nope, and hung up. LOL! Kept that message in the machine! When the calls ceased, we figured it was only a matter of time before someone showed up at the door, like they did for the real Census after we only gave the number of people living in the house. They tried to tell us we never sent it in. Our neighbors knew enough not to give any other info, too. I suppose the census people really love this neighborhood!</p> 
             <p> I talked with the friendly-enough man on April Fools Day. I gave him a copy of the letter from this site, and he said he had never seen that before. There is now a copy of it taped to our front door. He asked for our phone number and I refused to give it.We got a letter in the mail today, and a call from his number today, which went unanswered </p> 
             <p> My husband got talk with him today when he showed up with a business envelope with our name on it and letter inside, to leave in case no one answered the door. Made sure we know they know who we are.</p> 
             <p> Like I told him, he could come back but we still wouldnt answer the questions. He told my husband today that he did look at this site and found it interesting. He said he found other interesting links here, too. I heard him say the people I work for dont take no for an answer easily, and that they may come next time. Still wont get any answers to the super-nosy questions, and in case he reads thisMr. Milam, my husband was the one who got the letter out of todays mail saying you would be back, not me, and no one tore it up.</p> 
             <p>Oh, and he did ask my husband if hes a Tea Party member. Not on the questionnaire, but he asked, and my husband did say No. I dont think he should have answered, but oh, well.</p> 
             <p>Personally, if I was a census taker, I would rather run into a Tea Partier at the door than the average angry citizen. Tea Partiers have the reputation for being non-violent!</p>

             <p>Thanks so much for providing a source of terrific information and a forum for those of us angry/mystified enough to start researching the ACS. We got our first ACS in the mail a few weeks ago, followed by the second full survey and warning. We then got our handy postcard reminder and just yesterday received the big green postcard reminding us once again that its the law to fill it out. I feel certain that well get a knock on the door within the week</p> 
             <p>I have been sick to my stomach about this survey since it first arrived. The Census was enough of an intrusion into our home. This survey and what it asks for is an outrage. I am the mother of three young sons and as much as I would like to do the letter option on principle, Im afraid that I just cant handle the thought of these people coming to my door or pouncing on me in the driveway and harassing me until I give in. My inclination is to fill it out with the R for each question that I wont answer (which will be almost all of them) but I know theyll come to the door anyway. If I could, I would like to give them some answers that get to the bottom of what they want (well, what they want you to THINK they want) and provide them in a different way. Such as:</p> 
             <p>1) Number of people in house  check your census results (we are all legally in this country, by the way)<br> 2) We pay our taxes, receive NO handouts, and have no disabilities (you can dig up our tax returns to verify most of this information)<br> 3) Yes, we own our home and pay our mortgage and utilities (again, Im sure you can gather this yourselves)<br> 4) Someone in our house drives to work and does not use public transportation<br> 5) We dont use the abomination they call our local public school although our princely property taxes fund that disgrace</p> 
             <p>So, any advice for the angry citizen who is not necessarily prepared to deal with the inevitable harassment, or do I just swallow my anger, bend right over and fill it out as they wish? Help! Id love to end the nausea and sleepless nights over this!</p>

             <p>Update:::: . After what seems like dozens of dalls I finally got one when I didnt have my glasses near and therefore couldnt read the caller ID. I thought OH Hell. So I told the guy that there was 1 person living in the house and that was all the information they were going to get. He got nasty and threatening. I asked him to hold the line for a moment and just put the phone down. In about 10 minutes the line cleared and I got one call after another. So OK I finally got tired of my phone being tied up and answered another one. Same guy. I told him I wasnt gong to fill their Big Brother informational out , no matter what. He threatened me with a $5,000 fine. I said I didnt care what they did I wouldnt do it. He kept asking,,,  So you are refusing then I said that I was sending a letter to them, and he said he would report it to the Dept of Justice that I refused. Well, they still can go to HELL. I wont do this ,,,, no matter what the cost. I WONT DO IT.; . I read on another site that congress introduced a bill on the 11th of March to make this an optional or voluntary document, but dont know if that has developed. Hell they cant even keep the Government running.</p>

             <p>Hahaha,</p> 
             <p>Great to hear Bob! I like your enthusiasm and resolve! It amazes me that these people think they can just waste a persons time and energy with harassing phone calls, not to mention tying up your line with repeated calls. You would think  some supervisor, somewhere!  would tell that caller to stop and move on to the next one, ya know? They operate on a budget like any business and yet the Census can afford to spend SO much money of us hold outs. They drove out to my property  20 miles from town  at least 8-10 times that I am aware of. Thats a lot of time, money and effort to find out if I have any indoor pets, my phone number, when I leave for work and how many people live there. </p> 
             <p>If that were TRULY  TRULY the reason for this Census, each time they came out, they could tell when I left for work  or approximate times. They could tell if I had any pets. They can find my number in the phonebook or simply request it from AT&amp;T. The FBI does it without a warrant most of the time, why not just give the Census Bureau the AT&amp;T records? LoL That was a joke, but at this point, they might as well. I received phone calls on my cellphone  while I still had my out of state area code! So they already know how to contact me! They could clearly see that there were two adult vehicles at the home when they would come out everyday and no childrens toys were visible inside or out. But, they insisted on driving to my property each day to ask the same question and receive the same answers. Amazing.</p>

             <p>Hi Kevin : I posted earlier under Bob.<br> Update: After inadvertently answering the phone, I have been beseiged by the Census Bureau callers, and finally told the last one I was sending the form in and I did, without filling it out, and made sure that the code numbers on it did not show through the window (turned it backward) so they would have to find the letter. . When he threatened me with the fine. I told him he did not only not have any my permission to do that but that he needed to learn that in order to effecrively threaten someone he must have something they are afraid of. I feared nothing that he could or would do, so his words were falling on Deaf Ears . Call someone else and waste their time , I was sending the form in tomorrow. He tried threatening me again with, someone will call again in 2 days and I told him to call away, waste all the time you want, I wasnt susceptable to threats, and hung up on him. That was 4 days ago and so far I havent heard from them. I fully expect them to call and say they didnt get the survey. Ok Since they sent me 2, I will send the other one in the same way with the letter again. I dont know where this will go. But I WILL NOT DO THEIR BIG BROTHER Governmental intrusive informational no matter what. If they take me Away Hey Hey, Then so be it. Has anyone heard anything on the information I got that said that there was a bill introduced in congress on March 11 that made this obination voluntary. I would hope that there were enough of us that refused to do it that it would overwhelm them. . I will post any updates on here as they happen. ( If they dont take me away Hey Hey).</p>

             <p>Nothing since April 11th unanswered phone call where field agent left the message asking why we didnt just comply and then complain to our congressman. We didnt comply and fill the thing out, but I did contact our congressman, Tim Walberg, who, it turns out, is a co-sponsor of HR 931, a bill to make answering the ACS voluntary with no associated fines. I am waiting for a reply. Mr Walberg has been busy with townhall meetings.<br> Having read up quite a bit on this ACS thing, we are in agreement with the people who feel that saying no to answering the nosy questions does constitute a response, which is what the ACS demands, isnt it? Your response?<br> Anyway, it has been pretty quiet since the 11th.</p>

             <p>Just finished catching up on all these responses. Joining the rest of you in resisting this BS. Theyve sent me 2 forms also; I started to fill out the first one until I got so irritated I stopped. Called my congressman John Klines office &amp; all I got from one of his aids was well if its required by law, do it or words to that effect. Im not doing squat, except maybe squatting over this ACS form to do my business! LOL!<br> Ive also receive several calls from these clowns which I basically ignore &amp; Ive told my wife to do the same. Sad state of affairs to screen your calls in your own home.<br> Someone mentioned the possibilty of ID theft; good thought. Someone also mentioned the ACLU; theyre so pro-govt &amp; socialist, I wouldnt expect them to respond, hell theyll probably report you.</p>

             <p>I completed &amp; submitted the regular Census form in 2010. The ACS has been harassing me since February 2011.<br> I dont recall the exact date, but it definitely started then. First the mailings  received the post cards, but the envelopes didnt actually make it to me until March 2011 for some odd reason. I suppose the phone calls should have started in March, but Im always working and dont have caller ID to go with my simple answering machine. Who knows how many of their calls were missed.<br> About 3 weeks ago, the visits started. My building has doormen, and they have done an admirable job doubling as security. Any suspicious parties are turned away If you truly know Mr. Smith, you should be able to reach him via phone and have him let you up. The field reps have never called while on the premises.<br> **A rep did try my work # once  but got sent to voice-mail hell as I work in an organization with a call center. I doubt they could even verify that I worked there<br> The visits are random and never scheduled. The field representatives are caught on security camera and have been recorded as being anywhere from polite and professional to downright nasty (though surprisingly never belligerent). All are persistent and insist on killing trees by leaving unnecessary paperwork behind. A couple of them were brazen enough to attempt to run past the security guard and make a break for the elevators/ stairs. I would have LOVED to have seen footage or heard stories of either of those idiots getting carted away in cuffs for criminal trespass and/ or aggravated assault.<br> Via the power of Google, I have traced down a few of these field representatives. The Internet revealed who was married (well, it did for the lone female rep), who used Verizon or AT&amp;T as their cell provider (if they left a mobile #), where they supposedly worked or lived (if they left a land line #), even how old they are and what profession they supposedly held. It didnt do this for all the reps, but definitely helped me find out a great deal about them, for free. Without threat of a fine. Without annoying/ wasteful mailings, annoying phone calls, or nasty visits. So why is the ACS bothering with such draconian methods?<br> I have since armed the doormen with several articles found on the Internet disapproving of and protesting against the ACS. I will add your fine article to that list. I will also include the template letter to further confound and frustrate their unconstitutional efforts.<br> I hope the ACS fails miserably and dies a horrible death. It is ridiculously invasive/ intrusive/ obnoxious and a complete over reach of the Census Bureaus privileges and responsibilities.</p>

             <p>Did a little more research To the best of my knowledge, the American Community Survey is not a law enforcement agency, nor is it a collection agency. It also appears that the same laws that the ACS claims to use to protect a citizens answers from prying eyes should also prevent the ACS from submitting the answers  be they true, false or non-existent  to any other organization, including other government agencies. This would make it impossible for the ACS to enforce any penalties and collect on any fines. Anyone want to disagree?</p> 
             <p>let us all not forget that the ACS is of course a tremendous waste of time and taxpayers money!!!</p>

             <p>We have put chains and locks on all of our fence gates along with the letter from this site along with our atty.s card posted on the window where they can see it.. We have guard dogs outside at all times, so let them try and jump the fence! Lawyers are chomping at the bit waiting for them to actually levy a fine against someone for refusal to fill out the acs. Our atty advised us NOT to fill it out. He says it like signing a sworn statement that can be used against you. The acs states that they cannot share this info. with anyone else. thats total BS! Read the inserts that come with your survey. Sure, they may not share it but they will sure as hell hand it over if someone requests it. I am not sure how much the Freedom Of Information Act comes into play here, but I am going to look into that. What a HUGE waste of resources by our government! Many of these surveys are targeted, make no bones about that!</p>

             <p>Enjoyed reading the latest posts. I had another phone call today while I was on another line and it was quite threatening. It also referred to a case#. So I must be on case list.??? I caled my telephone provider and changed my number and made it unlisted and unavailable. I doubt this will stop those persistent (insert several expletives here) but it will slow them down for a while. I have a number of friends and relatives whom I shall call , but otherwise on utility bills and such I will not change the number. I expect them to start showing up at the door. Well a knock is like a phone ring. just a request. If I get too many I will post an envelope on the door with the template letter in it for them. I hope that the house passes the bill mentioned above and if it does, things will change. Whatever, they may take me away in chains and I still will not answer any of their damn Big Brother invasions of my privacy and liberty. . I am a little leary of signing a petition, especially with my name.. You know they may not be always truthful in the government today. I will watch for feedback on the petition above Thanks Laurie and all.</p>

             <p>Thank you so much for this post. I just received this survey a few weeks ago, and I really resent the way in which they try to pressure people into participating, when it is clearly an invasion of privacy and more importantly, it is unconstitutional. Most of us are too fearful of the government to stand up for our own rights in situations like this, but this is an excellent resource to help equip those of us with the information we need to be able to stand up for ourselves. I cannot thank you enough for sharing this information.</p>

             <p>I just recd the ACS today and, like many of you, was alarmed at all the invasive questions! Thank you for all the info on this website and the comments! I need a bit of advice if possiblewhenever I am gone from home for any period of time, I have housesitters staying at my place. How can I prepare them for any visits (they let phone calls go to the answering machine) that might happen in my absence? If the CB worker gets threatening, my housesitters might get frightened and end up giving info they shouldnt. I also let a music band use my garage for practice, even when I am not here. Ditto question about thatwere now talking about a sizable group of people to train how to handle things if Im not here! Is there a time period that there wont be any action, such as 30 days? Or could the action start sooner?</p>

             <p>I recieved the ACS in the Mail on the 27th of April 2011. The information requested is outside of the scope of the Federal government. Not only does it violate Article 1 section 2 clause 3 of the constitution it is also a direct violation of the 4th amendment of the constitution. I have made a few additions to the letter presented here and I am posting it here for others to use. Lets see how long it takes them to try to contact me. I am only going to fill in the box that asks for the number of people at the address. This way they cannot say I did not respond.</p> 
             <p>To Whom it May Concern,<br> Pursuant to Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the only information you are empowered to request is the total number of occupants at this address, and that may only be done in a Census year. My name, sex, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity, telephone number, relationship and housing tenure have absolutely nothing to do with apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives. Therefore, neither Congress nor the Census Bureau have the constitutional authority to make that information request a component of the enumeration outlined in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3. In addition, I cannot be subject to a fine for basing my conduct on the Constitution because that document trumps laws passed by Congress, and defines their power, or in this case the lack thereof. Also the personal information you are asking is of no business of the Federal Government and a violation of the rights forwarded every citizen under the 4th amendment, The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable search and seizures, shall not be violated. Even though this is not a census year I will provide you the Constitutionally required information that I provided on my census form last year.</p> 
             <p>Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 479 (May 26, 1894)</p> 
             <p>Neither branch of the legislative department [House of Representatives or Senate], still less any merely administrative body [such as the Census Bureau], established by congress, possesses, or can be invested with, a general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen. Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 190. We said in Boyd v. U.S., 116 U. S. 616, 630, 6 Sup. Ct. 524,?and it cannot be too often repeated,?that the principles that embody the essence of constitutional liberty and security forbid all invasions on the part of government and its employees of the sanctity of a mans home and the privacies of his life. As said by Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Ry. Commission, 32 Fed. 241, 250, of all the rights of the citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves, not merely protection of his person from assault, but exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from inspection and scrutiny of others. Without the enjoyment of this right, all others would lose half their value.</p> 
             <p>Note: This United States Supreme Court case has never been overturned.</p>

             <p>Well , on the day before my phone number changed, I got a total of 3 calls. I was napping on the last one and expecting my son to call and I answered it, (OOPS) At least this lady was nice and I told her I had sent the only thing in that I was going to. She tried to get me to do the thing on the phone as they ddnt have a record of having received it. (You dont suppose theyd lie do you). I declined and she said that was too bad because today was the last day. Since she was nice I told her to have a have a good day before I hung up. So Now lets see what happens. I will post anything further so all you nice folks may know what is next. </p>

             <p>So this farce called the American Community Survey really does have a 90 day limit to annoy people The mail came in February &amp; March the visits started in the beginning of April its now the final week (got a voice mail saying tomorrow is the last day) and they just resorted to leaving messages on my machine. I have kept all the voice messages they left behind. One of them actually sounded rude and threatening. I guess thats what bullies do when they know an answering machine cant talk back Perhaps I can use this in court to file harassment charges. The best part is these fools insist on leaving their cell numbers behind, saying call me or else!. Guess Ill post them in the restrooms at the local gay bar </p>

             <p>Last year I answered I believe three questions on the census form to the census worker that came to my door, number of residents, ages, and ethnicity. I gave no names although it wouldnt take the NSA, CIA, FBI, HLS, IRS, USPS, DOEd, or any number of other govt agencies to to figure it out. I declined to answer any other questions although the census worker did try his best to get them.</p> 
             <p>Yesterday I received my ACS form. Three weeks ago I received a notification from the IRS for an audit of my taxes. Coincidence? Probably, but it does make one wonder.</p> 
             <p>Ill not be answering anything more than number of residents on the ACS form and will be including a copy of the letter shown in this blog. Will it matter to them? Probably not. Will I be fined? I actually hope I do, my congressman will get an earful if I do.</p>

             <p>I have experienced much of the same as far as those that have posted above. My harassment first started last year with the 2010 census. I filled out the required information ( number of people living at my house ect) send in the form. Sometime over the summer a Census worker showed up at my house claiming I did not answer their form. I advised her I did and please do not come back to my property. </p> 
             <p>Two days later a different Census worked showed up at my place of employment( I live in a small town where people know each other) She requested I answer her questions I again advised her I had already answered all the questions that I was going to answer when I sent in the form and walked away from her. The last thing I heard her say was well we will just keep trying. The next day I was home doing yard work when my dogs started barking like crazy. I walked around to the front of my residence and found two different Census works on my front porch. This time a male and female both of whom I somewhat knew thru my employment . The female husband is the county detective where I live and the male is a retired state police officer. Both requested I answer their questions. I again advised them that I had already fill out a census answering all questions that the US Constitution required me to answer . I then requested them to leave my property since they were trespassing, I was giving them verbal notice to leave. Both attempted to threaten me with fines for refusing their questions. I again advised them to leave or I was going to arrest them ( I identified myself as a police officer) I was then told by the male worker that if I didnt answer their question they would have to ask my neighbors. I told both to ask my neighbors any and all questions they wanted ,but to do so off my property since again I was telling them to leave. I then felt that since I was the complaint as well as the victim in a trespassing incident that it was best to call the police. I advised them one more time to leave or I was calling the police<br> When both just stood there on my front porch I told them I was going to get my cell phone and when I returned if they were still standing on my porch I was calling the police. When I returned they both were still on my porch I then made the call. Both left my property while i was on the phone with the police,but just walked next door to one of my neighbors. The police arrived spoke to me and then went to speak to the two trespassers the retired state police officer attempted to show his retired police badge to the officers, the wife of the county detective only mentioned who she was married to several times . The bottom line of this incident was they told the two officers that they had no idea if I had sent in a form or not they only knew my name was on a list of people to be interviewed about the 2010 census. Both were told not to come on my property again by the police since I had informed the police that I did not wish to press charges just wanted them to stay off my property. I also found out later that the females husband ( County detective had called my place of employment about 30-40 minutes before the Census workers showed up at my residence requesting information from my office if I was on duty he left no message and did not called back with any official business after this incident) This call by him appears to be done for his wife so she would know where to go to speak to me. So much for the Census worker not sharing any information to others about you.</p> 
             <p>Well since then I too have received a ACS form three times in the mail and had my 2008 tax return audited this year by the IRS. I now just received a letter from a field rep requesting I call to make arrangements for a in person or phone interview to answer the ACS. I guess the next step will be additional calls, letters and in person visits to my home or work place ( nothing but pure harassment is coming my way)</p>

             <p>I have contacted my local representative, senators &amp; even President Obama about this very intrusive form.<br> I have taken out my land line and notified friends &amp; family to contact me some other way. We have Private Property No Trespassing signs on out property so if they come around I will call the police and have them arrested. I think Ill video them on my property and take pictures.<br> There is a posting mentioning H.R. 931, please go online &amp; print out this law and take along with a letter of complaint to your local representatives, senators and go online to Obamas website and tell him directly. May not do any good, but cant hurt. Call your local TV stations about this and maybe one of them will do a story about these people the ACS.</p>

             <p>May 6, 2011, We have been visited by ACS rep. Wasnt home at the time but male asked neighbor when we would return? The answer given,didnt know, dont keep up with them. Neighbor called me via cell phone and informed me. I went to the local police station and was advised to call them if the man returned. My property is posted,NO TRESPASSING. &amp; NO SOLICITING. The ACS reps are not LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS and have no authority whatsoever to violate state trespassing laws. One additional note worth remembering start photographing the person who comes to your door along with a photo of their vehicle as well!.</p>

             <p>My husband and I just received our ACS last week. We already have received the first reminder postcard. We, too, had declined to answer many of the questions on the original short form Survey we received. At that time, we were contacted twice by census workers resulting from our refusal to respond. The second time a supervisor came to cajole us into responding. We declined. I find it suspicious that we now have received the ACS. Our neighbors have not received it. The questions on the ACS are incredibly intrusive and we do not intend to respond, having answered the questions that we believe appropriate, already. Contacting our congressman or senator is a lost cause; we live in the most liberal area of the country. I will let this site know what the government does next. It is quite shocking, disappointing and very disturbing that we would live to see the day that our government has become as intrusive and retributive as this one has. We look to this site to see what we can expect.from Big Brother.as the process continues.</p>

             <p>Nobody worry about being fined. If they ever fine anyone, it will give that person standing to sue in federal court on the constitutionality of the thing. They dont want that, they can still get some ignorant people to fill it out and send it in.</p> 
             <p>We got our forms and postcards last October, they apparently dont have our phone numbers, we havent been listed for as long as I can remember, so we didnt get any calls. Not everyone is selected for home visits, I think its one out of 3. We were never visited. </p> 
             <p>I was prepared to buy and put up no trespassing signs and call the police if people we dont know continually banged on our door. I started keeping all the storm doors latched when we were home. Also I would have taken the form around to show all the neighbors and ask them to deny any knowledge of us and we would return the favor when their time comes. I shred everything with any name or number on it before it goes in the trash. I was prepared to take pictures of any person on my property along with their vehicle and license plate if they caught me outside. I was prepared to use any materials they left to gather information on them and mail it to them anonymously, lets see how they like it. I have been known in the past, having found a stranger in my backyard inside the fence, to order them off my property at gun point, Im not afraid to do it again.</p> 
             <p>My husband refused the regular census also but the guy knew where he worked and called him there after I wouldnt answer the door. He has known the guy for over 30 years, my husband told him W_____ there are 2 people living in our house and that is all the information I intend to give. If you need more than that, make something up. If the same guy had been assigned to harass us about the ACS, I have a feeling he wouldnt have bothered.</p> 
             <p>If we get sent the ACS again we know exactly what to do.</p>

             <p>This is a follow up to my post on May 6, 2011.<br> On May 10, 2011, ACS rep., knocked on our door. Please keep in mind that our home and land is posted and clearly visible for all to see. Boundary markers are evident. The ACS rep., began his speil and I informed him I needed to get dressed to wait a minute. A short time later I came to the door and went out on our front porch. He began that he was an authorized agent of the Census Bureau and that he was there to complete the ACS Survey. I inquired no less than three times if he was a Sworn Law Enforcement Officer of the US Government. He intimated to me that in fact he was and that the No Trespassing, No Soliciting signs that were posted did not pertain to him, and that I could call the police for verification. I then handed him a copy of the Bill of Rights and a copy of Mr. Haydens letter. He looked it over and stated he had already seen this. I replied,  Sir, I now invoke those rights as enumerated in the Bill of Rights and inform you that I invoke my Miranda rights as well. Now, I know that you have no law enforcement authority. If you will kindly turn your head to the left you will see that there is an Grey in color marked Police Cruiser to which I raised my hand and the officer drove up to the entrance of our house. You see sir, I did in fact call the police and now they will take control of the situation. The ACS rep., was interviewed by the police to which they summoned me over to them and informed me to state in their presence of my wishes. I again stated this is private property and clearly posted and this man had twice violated the sanctity of my home. That he had purported to be an law enforcement officer and that the laws of our state did not apply to him. The officer then informed him that he was not to say another word and to depart this property immediately and to never return. That I was completely in my rights and that even he(local police) could not come on this property without invitation or with service of process or a warrant absent any exigent circumstance. </p> 
             <p>I hope the readers will understand they are empowered and that their rights cannot be abridged. INVOKE YOUR RIGHTS AND DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THEM. WE REFUSE TO BE INTIMADATED IN OUR OWN HOME. Our thanks to Mr. Hayden and his web site.</p>

             <p>Thank you Mr. Hayden! I have spent the better part of my morning reading your blog. I have received several reminders, including a calling card on my front door. I have been putting off dealing with the ACS because it not only invades my personal information but my TIME as well! It just ticks me off. </p> 
             <p>I was so pleased and relieved to find your well written letter and will use it with my form. I cannot stomach the idea of handing over so much personal information to someone who has no business knowing it. I am outraged at this violation of privacy. It is a slap in the face to the framers of our Constitution, not to mention the untold numbers of men and women who have literally fought and died for us to be free of this king of tyranny. </p> 
             <p>For anyone that is still mulling this (fill it out/not fill it out) over in your mind  good! My advice is to think back to when you first opened the survey and scanned the questions. How did you feel? SICK? Then, go with your gut.</p> 
             <p>I have no problem with the 10 year census but the ACS terrifies me. Absolute power corrupts, absolutely. I will be contacting my rep to notify him of my opinion. Thank you for standing in the gap!</p>

             <p>Dear Representative __________,</p> 
             <p>I would like to know your position on HR 931 to make the American Community Survey voluntary. Also, what is the current status in congress. </p> 
             <p>It is my hope that you are or will support H.R. 931, to allow the American Community Survey to be optional. Congress should not force private citizens to give out extensive detailed personal information to the federal government.</p>

             <p>Enjoyed reading all the latest posts. My sincere ThanK You again to you Hayden. Since I changed my phone number and made it unlisted I have had no further calls. However last Saturday a guy parked at the end of my driveway and walked up and up my stairs. ( I have a two story house, front entrance is into the top floor) He had a laptop in his hand and since my front window blinds were open (thank you Carolyn), I opened the door and saw his Census bureau name tag, He identified himself and said he was the representative in this area and we could now complete the Survey. He was pleasant and professional so I gave in and was pleasant and nice when I told him Not only No but Hell No. I gave him a copy of the letter I sent in . He acknowledged my prior refusal and said, well maybe we could get just the basics.This is when my patience ran out. I said, still nice for him to remove himself from my property and not to return. I would not participate under any circumstances. That if anyone else showed up I would immediately call the police and have him arrested for trespasing and Harrassment. He just said Ok understand and left. I havent seen anyone since. If someone else shows up I will indeed call the police. . I hope I have seen the last of them.</p>

             <p>I would bet money that they already know who RESIDENT is otherwise how do they get your phone number when you havent sent the form back or choose to leave your phone number off the form?</p> 
             <p>We were called before they would have gotten the form back and after reading all the blogs on this and several other websites it has since met with disposal. They called within several days after we got the 2nd form.</p> 
             <p>Have signs posted on our property NO TRESPASSING, PRIVATE PROPERTY. So far we havent gotten any home visits. Maybe we will be the 2/3 that doesnt get them.</p> 
             <p>Again, please notify your Senators, Congressman and any one else that you may need to and tell them this isnt acceptable and you want them to support H.R. Bill 931. May not do any good, but cant hurt to try.</p>

             <p>Received my ACS survey today and immediately called my representative. His aide told me that my representative, Steve Austria, is supporting HR 931 and that it is currently on the dockets in the House Judiciary Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the Government Reform Committee. You might consider contacting members of those committees as well  Im working on that tonight! </p>

             <p>I looked on the website for H.R.Bill 931 and they now have 20 co sponsors, but I dont see Steve Austrias name on it. It may be that the website doesnt have him on there yet.</p> 
             <p>More people need to contact their representatives and senators. I have contacted all of mine, but havent heard anything from them. Dont really expect to since AZ politicians have more to worry about than complaints about the ACS. I think they are for it rather than against.</p>

             <p>Of course I did not answer or return the ACS. This is simply intimidation and dossier building in one easy step. Weve seen that before and it didnt turn out so good.</p> 
             <p>Considering the ACS is already voluntary, HR931 seems to be helpful but questionable at the same time. Can future amendments to this Bill increase the bits of information it allows ? Sorry if I come off hard nosed about it, but legislating something already unconstitutional creates a useable wedge for future add-ons. </p> 
             <p>More importantly, such a Bill relaxes the population once again, just as we are beginning to rouse ourselves to stand up against this and other totalitarian steps toward a full-fledged police state. The fact that ACS is something most citizens can get easily riled up about is a good thing, and has produced the kind of wide-spread dialogue and resistance we have needed for a while now. Waking up and drawing a line in the sand is what we need to do on alot of issues.</p>

             <p>Hello, great support site!!! I received my first survey on 4-27-11 and the second a few weeks ago. Initially I was shocked at the questions, now Im just mad!!! I have no plans on completing the survey. When I got home today there were 2 messages on the recorder asking me to call them. So, it appears Im on deck for the constant harassing and threats. I originally sent my Congressman a letter and he responded with info on HR 931. Hopefully that starts some movement soon. Wish me luck</p>

             <p>Just got the ACS in the mail. Thanks to all the posters and to Mr. Hayden for your hard work helping to inform average Americans about the intrusive and very likely unconstitutional ACS.<br> Mine is going back in the mail today with the date (because Im just a warm, fuzzy tell-all kind of guy) and the number of people at my address. EVERYTHING ELSE gets the R in the block. EVERYTHING.<br> This is June 2. We will document all interaction with ACS, telling whoever calls that we are recording the calls and if someone shows up, we will take pictures with our cell phones as we are calling the sheriff.<br> And as soon as Im done with this post, a letter to my Congress-Critters will go in the mail about the ACS and noting some of the more ridiculous and prying questions to which my government has NO RIGHT.</p>

             <p>Just called my congressmans office to ask his stance on this. The person answering did not know. Said he will pass it along to him &amp; get back to me. I will also be refusing. Asking if anyone in the household has trouble climbing stairs is not govt. business. Ill be preparing to get audited by the IRS, because honestly I think not answering triggers a flag to the IRS. Ive read on too many sites of people getting audited after not answering. Not worried though because I keep excellent records.</p>

             <p>I got the ACS on 5-27 &amp; immediately found this website. I am sending the ACS back unanswered with your letter example attached. I have already gotten a post card reminder after 1 week! Crazy. I added to the letter that they should mark us as refusing to answer &amp; do not contact us again in any way. Doubt it will help, but it is worth a try. I am very proud of our CO rep Mike Coffman for being a co-signer to HR 931 although I do understand aas arguement against it in that it may be a foot in the door rather than just stating that the ACS is unconstitutional. But it is a step in the right direction. It also makes me very mad about all my tax dollars being spent on this census crap. Thank you so much for this blog! It really is a big help.</p>

             <p>Kevin, Just a note to let you know if the ACS is not part of the Census Bureau they have me fooled. Ive received two forms, numerous phone calls and two visits so far. Ive yet to speak to anyone and have simply refused to communicate. Today I receive d a letter form the US Dept of Commerce U.S. Census Dept noting that a certain rep has contacted me to do an interview.It then proceeds to give the same spiel regarding commerce etc that I believe should be done on the local and not fed level.The rep has now started calling leaving her name and # not a undisclosed #. I sent and email to my Congressman who slowly responded that it was the law and though he understood my concerns with the invasiveness of the questions I would be required to respond. I then sent him a question concerning his support of H R 931 and have yet to hear on that. Each time I open the form and look at it my blood pressure rises to unstable levels!!</p>

             <p>So far we havent even been visited by the ACS goons and it is almost the middle of June. Wont do them much to come as I have Trespassing signs out and will call the Sheriff if necessary. Not answering the door unless I know who is at the door thru the peep hole.</p> 
             <p>Hopefully, well be one of the 2/3 that doesnt get visited.</p>

               <p>Thats great to hear, Clinton! </p> 
               <p>While it might be a bit of a different approach, I honestly think making the Census worker as uncomfortable as possible is a great way in which to have some fun with civil disobediance. They came to YOUR house, remember that. THEY disturbed YOU. So, I encourage unique and unusual ways in which to greet them. And dont worry, Im sure youll have several chances in which to shock them at your door. Hahah.</p> 
               <p>And thank you for the comment and compliments!</p>

             <p>Here is an update on my plight.<br> I did contact my Congressman, and let his office know my displeasure with the ACS.<br> They have told me I am not the first to complain, and that they are taking this seriously.<br> They were very polite and careful to tell me they could not Tell me to or Tell me NOT to fill out the ACS.<br> I received a letter fom my Congressman, aide in his office I am sure, registering my complaint and concern.<br> This letter also trys to explain the need for the ACS, and the method of participant selection.<br> This letter does say the following:<br> The ACS is conducted under authority of Title 13, united States code, Sections 141 and 193. Response to this<br> survey is required by Section 221 of Title 13. The Census Bureau may use this information only for statisticial<br> purposes.<br> Title 13 requires the Census Bureau to keep all information about you and all other respondents strictly confidental.<br> Any Census Bureau employee who violates these provisions is subject to a fine of up to $250,000 or a prison<br> sentenence of up to five years, or both.</p> 
             <p>The letter also goes on to state the following:<br> I share your concerns about the length and intrusiveness of these questions. I will be examining the issue closely<br> with my colleagues during the 112th Congress to see if legislative remedies can lessen this burden. If you need<br> more information or have further questions about the survey, call the Census Bureaus Customer Services Center<br> at 1-800-923-8282.</p> 
             <p>I am pleased that I actually received a response from my Congressmanss office and that I was not just Handled this gives me hope that all is not lost in DC.</p> 
             <p>I would suggest that everyone contact their representatives and speak out loudly against the ACS, I am sure many of us will be handled, our calls will be taken and forgotten, but maybe just maybe if enough calls are being taken we might wake up a few of our Representatives and they will remember all of us out here.</p> 
             <p>Good luck to all</p>

ADDITIONAL SPONSORS  (House of Representatives  May 31, 2011)<br> I see the following<br> Under clause 7 of rule XII, sponsors were added to public bills and resolutions as follows:<br> Many lines skipped for brevity.<br> H.R. 733: Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania and Mr. Pastor of Arizona.</p> 
             <p>Does this mean that Congressman Tim Murphy has signed on as a Co-Sponser?<br> If this is the case then I want to congratulate him for being with us, and if this is indeed the case I will do this in writing.</p>

             <p>Im really glad I found this website. My whole family thought that the ACS sounded too intrusive and that it couldnt actually be allowedWe will most likely be using several of the suggestions Ive seen on here; so far weve only received the ACS twice, so were pretty early on in the process. Ill keep reading to see what happens with everybody! ?</p>

             <p>My wife threw out the first survey letter accidently. The second one arrived not long after and I sat down to fill it out. Like a previous commenter stated my blood began to boil over the intrusive questions. What time do I go to work? Ill be damned if Ill answer that. Ive got a wife and mother who both have disablities and their safety could be compromised by someone knowing when I come and go.<br> One other thing. They called and said I need to send in the survey. I said I did and they suggested I complete the form over the phone. I said no, I sent it in. They gave it a week to show up and then they called again wanting me to take the survey over the phone. I got angry and said no I sent it in. They said theyd give it until June 24 which is the deadline to see if it shows up and then theyd call me to do it over the phone if it didnt show up. I now firmly believe they got it but found it not filled out completely and want me to give the answers over the phone. I believe they got it and are lying. Anyone else get this treatment? Ill be calling their bluff on Thursday.</p>

             <p>Hello Kevin, thank you so much for sharing all this information.My story goes like this: I received my Census survey last April. I filled out 2 people in household. Thought the other questions werent relevant to anything important. I did not send a cover letter, wish I had known I would have. About 2 weeks ago I had my first visit. There was an envelope stuck on my gated driveway. Which was shut. With a note inside telling me to call Angie Huffman, its important we get back to her regarding this. Since I complied with the survey, I thought nothing of responding. Today I come home to find another request for appointment notification on my gated driveway again. Now Im really ticked off. I contacted an attorney who never heard of such a thing. Told me I was on my ownbelieve that. I question the harrasement routine. I questioned my rights. He had no clue. I also read the law that said a refusal was $100 fine, $500 for false info. So I fiqured Id just refuse and pay the fine. Then came across your web site. Have a wonderful letter ready to go out tomorrow. I also know that it is against the law to leave anything on personal property. If they want to inform you of anything it needs to be mailed to your address. So I have that question. Im taking much of your advice, Im not refusing, Im sending how many people live in this household. Thanks again, Will keep you posted.</p>

             <p>Sent to Rep Mike Ross (AR)<br> What is with this American Community Survey baloney? These questions are too invasive and have nothing to do with selecting the number of representatives for Congress. We answered the basic questions on the real census, and I have no intention of telling some Big Brother bureaucrat when we come and go. As for any information remaining confidential, that is a laugh, not to mention that it is a blueprint for robbery and identity theft.</p> 
             <p>Please be advised that I am retaining my Constitutional rights and refuse to answer these very nosy questions. This is information that I would never ask of my friends and neighbors, as it is none of my business. It is also not any of the governments business.</p>

             <p>This is a great site, and I look forward to reading about other topics here.</p> 
             <p>I got the notice, and then the ACS just a few days ago, and being an old contracts guy, I stalled out at the first question: full name. The next question, phone number, brought me to attention. Why does the census department need to know this? Never mind the other intrusive questions I looked at later.</p> 
             <p>So, I let it settle for a few days, and then looked further into the survey. Hog wash. They did fail to ask how many (evil) guns I had, and whether I was a member of the Tea Party (I am), and about my New York representative Anthony size, but they would certainly be asking that and more in the next version of this survey.</p> 
             <p>I was intrigued that they asserted that I could be fined for failing to fill out a survey, especially since they had no proof of service (certified mail) that they had ever sent me a survey. I also doubt that Fex Ex would accept a delivery to Resident if they needed proof of delivery to get paid. For the record, every piece of mail that I get addressed to Resident goes into the trash unopened, if anyone should ask.</p> 
             <p>When I finally asked Google about Title 13, it immediately suggested Section 141, and the second hit was this excellent site.</p> 
             <p>After carefully reading 108 posts, I have gathered that responding at all to this ACS crap is pointless. Treat them like any other telemarketer or spam purveyor. Ignore them until they come to your door, and then treat them like any other trespasser  call the sheriff. (BTW, in the end, the sheriff is *the* local authority. Get to know them and their deputies. Pay careful attention to their election and policies.)</p> 
             <p>Best to all, and special thanks to Hayden.</p>

             <p>Updatewell I guess it was the acme of foolishness to believe they would stop.</p> 
             <p>Though the phone calls stopped 8 days agotoday a man shows up ringing my front door bell with his notebook computer in-hand &amp; opengeeto bad I couldnt get to answer before he left.</p> 
             <p>He did leave the following note:</p> 
             <p>Dear Resident,</p> 
             <p>I am trying to contact you regarding the survey you received in the mail about 6 weeks ago. I can tryat a later date to complete the survey with you on a laptop computerit wont take long. Also, we can complete the survey over the phone (local phone #) if you prefer. If you have already completed the survey, do not mail it; I will pick it up and send it overnight by FedEx. When we talk, I can answer any questions you may have concerning this important survey. All information you give is strictly confidental and you can refuse to answer any questions which you might feel uncomfortable answering. Thanks,  (printed name)</p> 
             <p>1) mailed it 14 days ago..guess he wasnt notified they had received it!!!!!</p> 
             <p>2)you can refuse to answer any questions Hmmmm!!!</p> 
             <p>3) What the are they doing?!! They received it  I can refuse to answer any questions  yet they still send the man out!?!???</p> 
             <p>And our lawmakers are having to work overtime solving budget issuesgo figure.</p> 
             <p>What do you make of this?</p>

             <p>Well, I got my 1st home visit yesterday. I was not home, at work, but they left a nice letter basically demanding I call them and complete the survey. I will stay stronglol! I got out the survey to look it over again and am still outraged at the questions. If its an anonymous survey, why do they need my name and date of birth. I would not mind completing SOME of the survey just not the personal stuff! How long will the phone calls and visits continue? I received the 1st survey on 4-27-2011.</p>

             <p>Just found your website and have found it very informative. Wouldnt national exposure on this issue be helpful? One who comes to mind would be Judge Andrew Napolitano of Freedom Watch. He certainly is opposed to runaway government in all its forms. I have tried to find a way to contact him in the hopes of asking him to address this invasion of privacy but have not been successful. Can anyone help me on this. Will look for your response.</p>

             <p>Hi, there. I am an attorney in Missouri. I am sending them the following letter with the survey, which is basically your letter, with minor revisions. If you dont hear from me again, it worked and they didnt bother me again. Otherwise, I will post follow ups.</p> 
             <p>July 11, 2011</p> 
             <p>RE: Attached American Community Survey</p> 
             <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p> 
             <p>I am returning to you the American Community Survey filled in with only the information I am legally required to complete, which is the number of occupants at this residence. All other questions are intentionally left blank.</p> 
             <p>Pursuant to Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution, the only information the US government is empowered to request is the total number of occupants at an address. The occupants name, sex, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity, telephone number, relationship and housing tenure are unrelated to apportioning direct taxes or determining the number of representatives in the House of Representatives. Therefore, neither Congress nor the Census Bureau have the constitutional authority to make that information request a component of the enumeration outlined in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3. In addition, a citizen cannot be subject to a fine for conducting oneself in a lawful and constitutional manner.</p> 
             <p>In addition to the above constitutional authority, I also object based on my constitutional right to privacy. In addition, I object based on the following Supreme Court case:</p> 
             <p>Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447, 479 (May 26, 1894)</p> 
             <p>Neither branch of the legislative department [House of Representatives or Senate], still less any merely administrative body [such as the Census Bureau], established by congress, possesses, or can be invested with, a general power of making inquiry into the private affairs of the citizen. Kilbourn v. Thompson, 103 U.S. 168, 190. We said in Boyd v. U.S., 116 U. S. 616, 630, 6 Sup. Ct. 524,?and it cannot be too often repeated,?that the principles that embody the essence of constitutional liberty and security forbid all invasions on the part of government and its employees of the sanctity of a mans home and the privacies of his life. As said by Mr. Justice Field in Re Pacific Ry. Commission, 32 Fed. 241, 250, of all the rights of the citizen, few are of greater importance or more essential to his peace and happiness than the right of personal security, and that involves, not merely protection of his person from assault, but exemption of his private affairs, books, and papers from inspection and scrutiny of others. Without the enjoyment of this right, all others would lose half their value.</p> 
             <p>Note: This United States Supreme Court case has never been overturned.</p> 
             <p>Sincerely,</p> 
             <p>My Name<br> Attorney At Law</p>

             <p>I received the Postcard first reminding me to send in survey and then the Survey at the end of May. We were going on vacation the first week in June so I disregarded it. Shortly after we got back from our trip sure enough I had another survey. After reading your site and many peoples responses I decided to fill it in with Head of Household and only how many people resided at this residence and with the letter R on every other question. I sent that back around June 18th. I received my first phone call today from the Census Bureau while I was on another call. They left a message on voice mail stating it was the US Census Bureau Telephone Center and to please return their call at some 800 number and to reference Case Number blah blah blah So, I guess it has begun. I have no intention of giving any more information but am really nervous about possible in person confrontations. I find it all very stressful. If anyone can give me some good language to use should the inevitable Census Worker show up at my door.. Id sooo appreciate it </p> 
             <p>Also Ive heard that this Survey is eventually going out to EVERYONE. they are just sending it out to 250,000 people at a time. </p>

             <p>Attorney in Missouri great letter that others should use when dealing with these idots. You can also post No Trespassing signs on your property and if necessary call the police or sheriff and have them removed from property. You can also have them arrested especially if they are entering your back yard and looking in your windows.</p> 
             <p>As for nervous in Michigan, you can refuse to talk to them. You are not obligated to talk to them or answer your door or your phone. Who cares if they know your home. Its your home. It will be over in 3 months.</p>

             <p>Dont be nervous or discouraged. I have ignored all phone calls and have not answered the door for any home visits, and have ignored letters left taped to my front door with threats of fines. Ive never sent any surveys Ive received back. After finding this site, I printed Mr. Haydens letter and taped it to my front door along with a Private Property, No Trespassing, No Soliciting sign. The last visit from the Census person was 8:40 pm on Fathers Day night. She saw the letter on the door with the sign and didnt bother to ring the doorbell, although she did take the letter with her. She also left another letter taped to the door advising me of a $500 fine for not answering the ACS. After that, I received a FedEx overnight letter advising that another person would be coming to get me to fill out the survey. That was almost 3 weeks ago. Ive not been bothered since and still have the Private Property, No Trespassing, No Soliciting sign hanging up. I also contacted my Congressmans local office regarding the extreme level of harrassment. Thanks for all the info on this site. We must all stand together and NOT give in.</p>

             <p>Thank you so much to all who have posted on this site and to Mr Hayden for creating it. So much good advice. I am printing Mr Haydens letter and taping it to my front door. I am going to also print out a No trespassing, etc sign until I can get an official one and also put that on my door. Thanks especially to Geronimo and Fed up for their personal responses to my post. I cant wait till the harrassment is completely over.. I WILL NOT GIVE IN!!!</p>

             <p>I received the ACS in April, 2011. At first, I thought it was a scam but, after doing some research, discover it was legit, sent by the federal government. I was not going to provide the requested personal information to the federal government and didnt respond to the ACS. Five days later I received a card stating that I must have forgotten to return it and then 2 weeks later I received another survey. Again, I didnt answer it. </p> 
             <p>In early June, I started getting phone calls from the Census Bureau. It always said Census Bureau on the call identifier (even though 3 or 4 different numbers were used). I never picked up the phone. The census representative left 3 messages. The calls continued, EVERYDAY, including weekends, for a month. Sometimes I received 4 or 5 calls a day. I received calls as late as 8:30 pm. </p> 
             <p>Last week 2 people pulled onto my driveway in a pick-up truck and knocked on my door. I looked through the door and walked away, refusing to open the door. They went back to the truck and wrote a note, which they left on my front door. The note stated that they would keep coming back (the next time with a supervisor) until I opened my door. They were good to their word and came back the very next night, at 7:15 pm. When I went to the door, the woman told me, through the door, that they would come back every day until I opened my door. I told her to get off my property and to never come back and that I would never open the door for them. I told them that the next time they came to my home I would call the Sheriff and have them removed. They havent come back (yet).</p> 
             <p>Today I received a letter in the mail stating that a member of our staff will contact you again in a few days. </p> 
             <p>This harassment is unbelievable. The ACS is not authorized by the law and the federal government has no right to collect this kind of personal information from me or any other citizen. Im hanging tough here in Florida but wondering how long this will continue.</p>

             <p>Just got the 2nd phone call and hung up the moment I heard the words Census Bureau. I will treat these folks like any other telemarketer. BTW, I never got any cards in the mail or another ACS form</p> 
             <p>When someone comes to the door, I will hand them a copy of Mr. Haydens letter and invite them to depart the premises before the Sheriff shows up. My congress-critter has yet to respond to my email about the ACS. Time to remind him.</p>

             <p>To harassed in Florida, hang in there you only have 2 weeks and 3 days to go. It should be over July 31st. We also got ours in April. It lasts 3 months and then they go and harass the next group of citizens.</p>

             <p>Well, another update. I was at work last night and my wife was at an appointment. My mother in law was here watching the kids when assigned case worker showed up at the house. She began asking lots of questions and told my mother in law that she had been in contact with me and that I had told her (the case worker) that it was ok for my mother in law to answer the questions. COMPLETE ABSOLUTE LIE! I have never spoken with this lady. She then had my mother in law call my wife and started harassing her over the phone and wanted to complete the survey over the phone. My wife told her that it wasnt going to happen and she hung up. The case worker then began badgering my mother again for info, trying to fill in the blanks. Fortunately, my mother in law told her that she didnt feel comfortable talking to her about us and that she needed to leave. Hopefully, Im just a few weeks away from the end, (received 1st survey on April 27). This is non sensetheir tactics are down right shady! Just more proof that our government needs to be torn down and rebuilt!</p>

             <p>Thanks for the encouragement, Fed Up with this Crap!!!. I read in earlier posts that the harassment only lasts 3 months. Im hoping thats true in my case. </p> 
             <p>I will never cave in. I feel so strongly that the ACS and the harassment that follows are wrong. I know my family and friends hope the harassment stops soon because their tired of my constant bitching about the Census Bureau.</p> 
             <p>Im waiting to see what the next contact will be  by phone or personal visit. Ill keep you posted.</p> 
             <p>Thank you, Kevin for this website. You did a great service by giving other Americans a voice and the encouragement to object to the ACS.</p>

             <p>WOW, did not expect this!<br> I called the Census folks (returning their call), a very nice lady asked me how many folks lived at the address, I responded. She then asked if my non-response on the form I returned was because I didnt want to respond to the questions and I said yes, it was. I followed up with And I refuse to answer any other questions over the phone or in person. She thanked me for my time and we ended the conversation very cordially.<br> Well, heres hoping the home visits go as well!</p>

             <p>I was sent 2 ACS forms, both of which I filed away and did not return. After a few letters, I then received a home visit from a lady named Susan Davis, who showed up at my door at 8;30pm on a weeknight. I was in the process of putting my two small children to bed when she arrived, and I answered holding my tired and upset daughter in my arms. She whipped out her laptop and starting asking questions and I just stared her down, until she finally said I guess this is a bad time. Uh yeah, you could say that. I gave her my first name only and my phone number and told her to call me.</p> 
             <p>Ive received countless calls and voicemails from her since then and have ignored them all. Somehow, she was able to figure out not only my last name, but the name of my wife as well. I dont know if she looked me up on the city appraisal website or went through my mail, but its pure harassment. Im going to send in the letter posted here with some personalization added, mentioning her detective work to figure out my last name.</p> 
             <p>Ill post again once its all over and done with.</p>

             <p>Lets see, to datetwo forms, one postcard, possible phone calls left on my caller ID, one visit, which after I refused over and over again, was followed by a Fed Ex envelope stuck in my door. But the real clincher is this, the letter in the Fed Ex envelope had the gals name on it that I was to contact (Marlys Smith). Today I received a friend request on Facebook and guess who wants to be my friend, yep, same name as on the letter!<br> During the visit I asked her what happens if I dont fill it out and she said they could fine me but that probably wont happen. Big brother (and sister) can take a hike as far as Im concerned, the questions in the ACS are outrageous!</p>

             <p>Thank you all for your advice. I just received their second packet with YOUR RESPONSE IS REQUIRED BY LAW written on the envelope, after throwing out the first envelope and the postcard about a month ago.

             <p>I am so glad that I found this site! I was deeply worried about being fined up to $5000 for not answering questions about my property value, what kind of house I live in, my income, my ethnicity, if I get paid vacations or bonuses, and so many more. I found the questions very invasive and had trouble recognizing how any of the questions had anything to do with federal or state monies being allotted to schools, hospitals, roads and firehouses, as the brochure says. IF this survey IS collecting data on where schools, hospitals, roads and firehouses need to be placed then how come I am not being asked whether or not my children attend public school, or how often I call 911 and how fast they respond? Or whether or not I have medical insurance and go to the hospital regularly and how nice are the roads in my town or are they ridden with potholes? The first time in my life that I decided to give Big Brother the benefit of the doubt and fill out a census, they take advantage of that and send me another one and then threaten to fine me an obscene amount of money if I dont participate. Thank you for this information and for sharing it with those of us who have been pushed to the point of Enough is Enough ?</p>

             <p>I guess I should keep my hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times, I going to be in for a wild ride. I too have received the first letter stating survey is on its way back in June. That was the first thing that ticked me off. Why waste tax dollars for the warning letter. Got the survey shortly after. Then he postcard reminder to make sure I fill it out and send it back. I am glad I read it before filling anything out. I could not believe the questions they wanted me to answer. I went to the website on the mailings and thought hmm, seems legit. I then did a Google search and only found a few things about it. I wanted to do some research as I never heard of this. I did fill out the official census last year. This after all is my civic duty. That even had me upset with the race questions. I put American at Other Race. I left this survey sit outside on the patio and forgot about it. We had some company over on Friday evening and showed them. They were blown away by the questions also. Well yesterday I received the second survey mailing. Yesterday I decided to do some more research. I found this and several other sites. 99% of the people on these sites have all voiced concern. The other 1% must work for the census bureau. I no longer have a landline. I have a cell for business. They should not be able to link that to my Address. But who knows? If I post signs on my property that trespassers will be prosecuted, and warn the first ACS worker to leave and tell your employer that. Can I have the next batch arrested? Seems conceivable. I had some prospective trash dumpers cited by calling my local PD. The dumpers left before the PD showed up. I gave him the names and truck plate number. Turns out I had some trash they dumped a few days before. I gloved up and found the same name as the guy I confronted. The police told me even with that the most he can get them for is trespassing as I did not see him dump the trash days prior. Any way seems as though I should be able to have them cited for trespassing if I include on the sign ACS employees or workers.</p>

             <p>I agree with JJK, I think the other 1% must work for the CB. We also did away with our land line an just have cells.<br> I have seen on this and other blogs that people have even been called on their cell phones. If you think about it your address is connected with your cell # and if they want to find you they will get your #. </p> 
             <p>We dont answer our phones if it there isnt a name attached to it. We just have one more week to go and its over.Our expiration date is July 31st. YEAH!!!</p>

             <p>For those few posters that promote the detailed questions for the benefit of city planners accross the country;<br> I understand your comments about the need for city planners to have access to valid information to be able to make informed decisions. However, this need does not and should not override  or be allowed to override by voluntary cooperation or coersion  the limits our countries founding fathers placed on the Federal Government.<br> If this information is vital to the decision makers in a community, then that community should pursue the information gathering  not the federal government.<br> The fact that this survey provides valuable information for communities does not change the fact that the survey goes beyond the constitutional duties of the Federal Government.</p>

             <p>JJK, its been about 3 months ago I found the expiration date for our form. I think if you type in the search box the OMB #+ACS you may find it that way. We received ours the first of April and from the other postings Ive seen it will end 3 months from the time you received your forms. If you received your form the first of May then yours would end the last of August.<br> Sorry, I cant be of more help on how to find the expiration date for your harassment.<br> The OMB # is at the bottom of the I think first page of your form.</p>

             <p>Here is my update</p> 
             <p>Last week the same woman came back to my door at 7:30pm, while I was at home alone with my two children giving them baths. She knocked and yelled for 10 minutes before I answered. Neighbors down the block could hear her screaming I know youre in there! Im not leaving until you answer this door! Professional, huh?</p> 
             <p>Once I answered, she was hot, sweaty and royally pissed. The temperature was around 101. I asked if she received my letter and she said no, so I went and got her another copy of it (the very letter provided on this page). After reading the first paragraph, she said this didnt apply since the letter is only good for the census and not the American Community Survey. After arguing with her some more, all the while holding my two kids nearby, I told her fine, Ill answer your questions.</p> 
             <p>Heres where the fun began. She asked how many people lived in the house. I said 4. Then, every single question that followed, totaling around 50-60 I believe, I answered refuse. She huffed and puffed through the whole thing, but I stood my ground and said refuse for every single one. At the end of it, she said, Gee, you sure have been a big help! I asked her, How did you figure out my last name and the name of my wife? Her response was, We have ways of finding out information! If that doesnt sound like 1940s Stazsi rhetoric, I dont know what does.</p> 
             <p>As far as I can tell the ordeal is over for me. My next door neighbor has a talk radio show on a major 50,000 watt AM station here in town, and Im going to be telling him the whole story. Hopefully he mentions it on his show, so more people become aware of this abuse.</p>

             <p>To Drew, that was great!!! She sure made herself look like an idiot and the neighbors were probably wondering what was going on and who is this crazy woman. I have said all along they already know who lives at RESIDENCE. All they have to do is look up the address in their database and theres your name.</p> 
             <p>I think this needs to be put out in a public forum so everyone will know what the ACS is and about there harassment tactics.</p>

             <p>I am experiencing the same harassment from the census takers in my area, as well.</p> 
             <p>I just moved into this house, yet they accuse me of not filling out my form. So I asked for another form. But they said they do not have any to send. And then they proceeded to tell me that there was some alleged deadline that was approaching, that I was in danger of missinggiving me only one week to comply.</p> 
             <p>I told them it was ludicrous to expect me to cater to their deadline, and giving me such a short amount of time to do so. They did not respond. And then just last Friday, they told me that I missed the deadline that was the night before. So I let it go at that, and then they sent another census worker to my house the following day. If I supposedly missed this deadline, why were they still try to get me to answer their damn questionnaire? Now, one week later, I am still getting calls. They even found a way to contact my landlord, as well as calling me on my land line number that I have given out to NO ONE.</p> 
             <p>I will take your advice, Drew, and give them your letter next time. Thanks for writing it.</p>

             <p>Update: The phone calls are continuing, I got 2 that I know of so far this week and they both left messages stating they were the CB and noting some case number. Tonights call was at a couple minutes before 9pm. Thank God for caller ID. We do not answer our phone unless we know who it is anyway but definitely not answering the CB. Im sure it wont be long and well have someone at our door. We work weird hours so good luck finding us at home. The No trespassing, etc sign is still up on the door as well as multiple copies of Mr Haydens letter. It urks me that I now make sure all my doors are locked at all times and that Im always wondering when that knock on my door will come. My husband is doing the same thing, he says hes keeping the Govt out! It also urks me how much money the govt has to be spending on this, sending that thick survey out multiple times to 250,000 homes each month, plus postcards, letters, phone calls, case workers, field workers. The more I think about it the more the hairs stand up on the back of my neck. I still stand firm that they are getting no more info from me. I will continue to update and look forward to reading everyones posts here. Lets me know Ive made the right decision</p>

             <p>I just received The American Community Survey in the mail. As I read through it, I became more and more outraged that they would think they have a right to my personal information, though I was chosen by address and not by person. To then read on several web site posts, that people are being harassed by phone and in person, my blood really began to boil. Hopefully I will be able to calm down and be polite, yet firm, after I refuse to fill out the personal questions on the second one. I would hate for them to show up right now. The first is being filed away. Thank you for the information. It is very helpful.</p>

             <p>Why cant we just rely on the 4th amendment of the constitution? In all of my reading of different articles and blogs, it appears that NO ONE has been fined. I think there is a reason the Census Bureau wont fine anyone; it will bring this issue to court. And, Im confident to say that in court the whole ACS would get thrown out because it is illegal, based on the 4th amendment to the constitution. If the Cencus Bureau fines just one person, their whole house of cards would come tumbling down.</p>

             <p>I have not had a chance to read through all the posts here, so this answer might already posted on here somewherebut I am wondering if it is possible to put a restraining order on these people. I receive about 3-4 calls per day at work, which our receptionist has now also confirmed that they try to get to me through her. This is complete harassment. And it could potentially threaten my employment, should it get out of hand. They have also harassed my dog walker, my neighbors and even had the audacity to somehow contact my landlord. Under this supposed law they keep quoting to me, the census bureau may have the right to conduct a survey, but they do not have the right to obtain the information by ANY means they choose, including breaking laws of trespassing, invasion of privacy and harassment. And WE should have a right to agree to the kinds of questions they are allowed to ask. Afterall, they claim this census information is for us.</p> 
             <p>AdditionallyI agree about not wanting to respond to questions on the phone. With all the fraud going on, how secure is a phone call any more. The supposed law says we MUST respond. But it does not say HOW or WHAT we must say. Therefore, my response has been to send me the questionnaire. And their only response to that, has been, We dont have any more questionnaires to send you. So I have complied with this law by responding. HA!</p> 
             <p>Can someone let me know about the restraining order? I called my Senators office, and the assistant told me to call the police.</p> 
             <p>Thanks all!</p>

             <p>The Census Rep came back to my house during overtime of the Womens world soccer final. My husband told her that he was watching the soccer final and couldnt speak with her. She asked him whether should wait until the soccer game was over and my husband responded, No, I wont talk with you then either. She asked whether whe could come back the next day and he said, Yes, but I wont talk to you tomorrow either. She asked why and he answered, Because I dont want to talk to you. </p> 
             <p>The next day we got a note on the door stating that we were selected by the government to respond to the survey and demanding that we comply because its required by law, blah, blah, blah.</p>

             <p>Well, I received my ACS two days ago and began to review the questions. After the first couple of seemingly non-invasive ones- the increasingly personal / private ones started to cause a festering stew of uneasiness inside of me. I then began to research about the ACS stands for and the implications of not filling the form out entails. Luckily, I was brought to this website and I feel I am much more informed than I was. (THANKS to EVERYONE who has posted above!)</p> 
             <p>My way of handling the ACS form was to only fill out the first two pages (with the exception of the phone number) and detached the remaining pages from the document. I am sure they (CB) already have access to this information anyway  as evidenced by some of the posters above. In any case, I believe we were indeed singled out since my wife in not a citizen of the US  and is rather a citizen of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam {While still a permanent resident of the US  i.e. Green Card Holder}.</p> 
             <p>I then printed the suggested pre-written template listed above and signed with my initials, date, and form numbers listed on the top and bottom of the page. Instead of sending this back with the pre-paid envelope that was included with the mailer; I sent them in a Priority Mailing Envelope with Signature Confirmation. This way, I have proof that this document was indeed sent to their office and signed as received by one of their personnel. </p> 
             <p>I then wrote my State Senator, Chuck Grassley, about my disgust with the ACS and my intentions of refusal to their invasive questions of personal and private manners  as a direct conflict to my Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness.</p> 
             <p>In preparations to their future visits  if there are any  is to post NO TRESPASSING, PRIVATE PROPERTY, NO SOLICITING signs in our front window; along with a lamiated copy of the above pre-written template on the front door. If and when they do come calling, I will be putting up 4 =&gt; 3? X 5? neon safety orange signs in my front yard extoling the virtures of such a Wonderful Organization  that is the CB. If anyone comes a knocking; I have already told my wife to only speak to them in Vietnamese and to call the police if they refuse to leave our property. {Thanks again to poster #74 as I we will be using this strategy as well}.<br> I will update my status as things occur over the next 3-months.</p>

             <p>THANK YOU!!! so much for this site. We have received numerous postcards, both copies of the forms (I threw the first away), and at least 50 phone calls. Today was the latest contact: a mailing sent by FedEx reminding us to fill out the form, its required, yada..yadayada. Ive got to be getting close to the end of the 3 months time frame. The FedEx driver said hes been delivering a lot of them recently, and he went on a rant about the amount of money the Census Bureau is spending. </p> 
             <p>My 19yo daughter was home from college when they made their last visit. She had missed my original rants and dinner table discussions while at college, and did give our name. It didnt take long and she was freaked out by the questions, and quickly told him that he needed to talk to me. He left a phone number, and a notice that I was required to respond within 3 days. Silly man  he left his home phone number!! I waited a bit, guessed when hed be out harassing some other poor schmuck, and called his house. I blocked the caller on my cell phone and it was refused by setting on his home number. So, I used a calling card and his wife answered. </p> 
             <p>I told her that I was Mrs. so-and-so and that Mr. X had left a notice that I was required to respond within three days. This is my response. Thank you, and hung up. That was two weeks ago. </p> 
             <p>We are in a small town in a rural area. There is no reason to worry about traffic patterns, the closest mass transit is 70 miles away. I refuse to answer race questions on ANY form. Just as refusing rights to people based on race is racism, so is the granting of special privilege and rights based on race. I certainly dont want anyone to know our work patterns (actually, we cant even figure it out!), and Im not about to give out a full picture of our finances. My children havent attended the local joke-of-a-public-school in years. </p> 
             <p>I keep hoping Ill be the one at home when the Census worker arrives. Im sure that the Sheriffs office would agree that stalking of my 12yo daughter (since shes the only one home when they show up) would be something that any parent should be concerned with maybe an evening in the local pokey will do the trick goshI hope they show up on a Friday: Both judges in this county usually go somewhere else each weekend</p>

             <p>Well I had yet another visit. Told them Im not doing it, its illegal, my gate is locked for a reason(our whole property is fenced, only exit to the road is gate at the end of our long driveway), and since the survey is illegal, they have no legal standing to be there, so they are trespassing if they come on my property. Then I told them to have a good day and turned and walked back up our driveway(I was on my driveway, she was on the road). And she starts YELLING as Im walking away, stuff like This is America! You need to follow the rules! If you dont like America, MOVE! And that I need to do research.</p>

             <p>We received our first survey in late May of 2011. We did not respond. We shortly thereafter received postcard reminder and then the second survey. We did not respond. Then in mid June the phone calls started. We did not answer the phone and havent to this day. Weve let the answering machine get the calls. They started with a recorded call that says This is a service verification. We will call you back later. We then received the calls from live people identifying themselves as the US Census Bureau and that we needed to call them back immediately and refer to case number XXXXX. As I have read all the other accounts on this site, I have expected the front door visit. I was hoping that I would be home to answer, but unfortunately, my wife was home when The Man from the Census Bureau came knocking. She answered the door, the man flashed a badge at here and identified himself as being from the US Census Bureau. My wife simply stated that she did not wish to answer any of his questions and politely asked him to leave the property. He responded by telling her that he did not want to know who she was. She closed the door in his face and he left. I fully expect another visit.<br> I have written both of my United States Senators and my Congressman about this invasive survey. I asked my congressman to support H.R.931 that is sitting in house committee. Of course nothing will be done because of the completely dysfunctional government in Washington D.C. Hey folks in Washington! Ya looking for some budget cuts? Start with the American Communities Survey and the Census Bureau! What a complete waste of taxpayers time and dollars.</p>

             <p>My family is just starting the ACS saga. I have done some research and may<br> have something to contribute. First, thank you to Hayden for starting this site<br> and giving us all a place to share ideas and comments. Thank you to all<br> persons that have contributed to fighting this invasion of personal privacy. For<br> the record, I am not an attorney and have no aspirations to become one.</p> 
             <p>The following link takes you to a pdf document by the Census Bureau that is<br> instruction for the census takers that confront Americans that do not conform<br> to the dictate of responding to the ACS. Page 30 of the 35 page pdf clearly<br> states the survey is voluntary and that respondents may decline to answer<br> any or all questions. The link is: <a href="http://www.census.gov/www/downloads/library/2004/" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/www/downloads/library/2004/</a><br> 2004_griffin_02.pdf I dont know if you can directly link off this. You may have to<br> cut/paste or type the link.</p> 
             <p>Our plan is to return the form with only the number of occupants answered. We will<br> attach Haydens suggested letter, edited to reflect the additional attachment of the<br> cover page of the pdf and page 30 (A3) with the sentence highlighted. We will put<br> the census envelope into a plain envelope and request return receipt. We will keep<br> a copy of letter, pdf, and return receipt available to present if some person from the<br> bureau shows up un-invited.</p> 
             <p>Hope it works for us. Ill keep you posted.</p>

             <p>Mr. Hayden-<br> First, thank you for all your inputs.<br> Has anyone ever been actually fined for failure to complete the forms?<br> If so, by whose authority?<br> And, can we actually make a case to defend ourselves using the 4th &amp; 5th ammendments or citing other court supported cases?<br> At what point does someone need to get an attorney involved?</p> 
             <p>This is so very frustrating and WORRISOME!</p>

             <p>Kevin, thanks for adding the link to that pdf. I just read it, but to me all it is simply a test program that they ran back in 2004 to determine the effectiveness and response rate of the ACS if they changed it to a voluntary program. Ill read it again, but I dont think this is ammunition for our immediate issues as it evidently hasnt been implemented.</p> 
             <p>Do you read it the same way or am I missing something?</p>

             <p>I agree that the report is originated in 2003/2004. The cover page of the report clearly shows reference to 2010 census, so I am going to stick with my position on this. I dont think they will push it beyond a second and third effort. Lets face it, our government does really have bigger fish to fry. My answer to them will be consistent, NO! We have changed messages on our phones to the generic computer voice and never answer the door unless we are expecting someone. Glad Kevin put the link on the site. Will keep the site updated if needed. Thanks again to Kevin and all contributors.</p>

             <p>I have not even had a chance to read it, to be honest. Its been a very hectic day for me, but I saw several of you commenting about it or not being able to read it, so I hosted it.</p>

             <p>Great website!</p> 
             <p>So far my experience mirrors that of others. I received two copies of the ACS survey, the post cards and got my first phone call earlier this week. I declined to answer the survey over the phone and agreed to mail the form. I attached a copy of the recommended letter (with the modifications suggested by the attorney from Missouri) to the ACS form and mailed it today. I answered very few questions.</p> 
             <p>My plan is to purchase a few No Trespassing signs and post them on my property this weekend. I intend to keep my camera near the door and take pictures of the ACS census worker and also pictures of their car. I will probably post the photos on photobucket.com to share. I might also take a video for YouTube in case Im visited by one of the more aggressive census workers.</p> 
             <p>BTW  Heres the correct link for the ACS PDF<br> <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/library/2004/2004_Griffin_02.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/library/2004/2004_Griffin_02.pdf</a></p> 
             <p>Note the characters acs/ between the .gov and the www that are missing from the other links</p> 
             <p>Also, any idea how many people get follow-up visits if they mail the letter with the ACS form?</p>

             <p>To Modoc Bob and others interested, its been since April 22, 2011, since I last posted, but I did finally hear from Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI) regarding the progress of H.R. 931, by snail mail today. Basically he apologizes for taking so long to reply and says, It has been referred to the House Committees on the Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees for review, and I am hopeful that we will move forward with this legislation soon. No real answer but its nice to get a reply!</p>

             <p>Im not totally sold on 931. It just seems redundant to me. If ACS is illegal anyways, then its NOT mandatory and all Congress is doing is making a new law to reiterate the true legalities of ACS.</p>

             <p>This spring I recieved the survey. I didnt have time to fill it out and was working on filling out when my husband asked what I was doing and what I need the information for. I told him we had received the special ACSand he told me no way were we going to fill that out. So then, a week or so later we got a postcard, then a follow up letter, and another survey was sent to us. Which we ignored. Then, we began getting phone calls starting in June, the called increased in frequency and became a twice a day occurance. My husband answered the phone day and it was THEMhe told them he would be contacting an attorney and then the calls stopped. Today, 8/8/2011, we got our first visit from a Census workerso I expect that the Fed Ex threat letter will come tomorrow if it plays out like others on this board. I told the short, lady that I would not be answering her questions and if they needed to contact their attorneys so be itwere in Colorado.</p>

             <p>So after receiving a couple of surveys in the mail and postcard reminders all going unanswered we received our first visit from the cenus rep, we were home at the time but we dont answer the door if we dont know who the person is, they must have heard we were home and stayed for 15mins knocking and yelling hello. They finally left and left us a note saying by law we had to answer the census. The lady has since returned every day of the week and even on Sunday morning. Sunday morning I had finally printed the letter and waited for her to stop knocking and as she was sitting writting another note I left the letter on the door, she took the letter and did not knock again and we thought we had finally rid ourselves of her. Tonite she came back and left a note saying someone else would be coming back. How long will they continue to visit? And has anyone in CA received a fine? I suffer from anxiety and would be a mess if I had to give a stranger all the information that they ask for on the census survey, they say of course its private information but is anything really 100% private nowadays, I think NOT. But at the sametime I dont have any extra cash for fines..So annoyed!!! As if I dont already have enough problems to deal with in my life now.</p>

             <p>something else to consider re: the constitutionality of this survey (which due to its coercive nature under the threat of fines is better described as an interrogation)</p> 
             <p>besides flying in the face of Constitutional protections embodied in the fourth and fifth amendments, it would seem also to be a violation of the 14th amendment-</p> 
             <p>Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</p> 
             <p>Besides trying to make an end run around due process by demanding private personal information under duress sans any warrant, subpoena or court order, the procedure by which one is selected for this treatment-</p> 
             <p>We randomly select about 3 million addresses each year to participate in the survey.</p> 
             <p>-would seem to also be antithetical to the notion of equal protection and application of the law- the lawfully implemented US census applies to all citizens/households and thus meets this standard, but randomly selecting some citizens for heightened scrutiny of their personal affairs under threat of a fine does not.</p> 
             <p>Of course the matter might not be seen as cut-and-dried by the courts, but its worth noting that the Supreme Court tends to apply a more restrictive interpretation of this clause in matters that would burden fundamental rights.</p>

             <p>Thank you for this valuable site. We have been hounded by the ACS for weeks. I threw out the survey, because I thought it was a scam. I never heard of the ACS, before I received one.</p> 
             <p>They called for a few weeks. I told them we wouldnt fill out the form. They came to our door a few days ago. The enumerator left when I threatened to call the police. Today, an envelope came from FedEx from the Census Bureau. I refused to accept it. Im sure theyll come back to our door. </p> 
             <p>Ive printed out your helpful letter. I will give it to them the next time they come by. I cant imagine any thinking American answering the personal questions on the survey. If everyone would refuse this invasion of privacy, that would put an end to this, once and for all!</p>

             <p>In the answer to the question: What are the penalties if I do not respond to the survey? page 3, it states: The Census Bureau is not a prosecuting agency. Failure to provide information is not likely to result in a fine.  In reading other sites, it appears that there is an instance or two of a fine (from the 1960s and 1970s), but it seems rare.</p>

             <p>My husband decided to take the census workers photo the next time they come to the door. As well as demand that they leave our premises. If they threaten us, stating that we will send a letter about the individual to the the Justice Department, hopefully will stop the harassment.</p>

             <p>This ACS is beyond creepy!<br> When does someone leave for work? What are they stalkers? Thieves? What about the people with small children? Just tell strangers about them? Let strangers know when the kids might be home alone?<br> They took an oath? Did the ACS people have criminal background checks? Are they drug tested on a regular basis. Are they mentally evaluated frequently? What about their stair climbing ability? What if they fall down our steps when they are trespassing? Are we sued? How do we know they arent drunk?<br> Has anyone done a survey of how many people were victims of crime after they filled out the ACS?<br> I have had four mailings, two of them surveys. And numerous phone calls, only two with messages.<br> On one of the messages the person had so much of an accent that I wouldnt have known what they were saying if I didnt have caller ID and hadnt heard a similar message on the first call.<br> Has anyone heard of spoofing? Where a number can show up on the caller ID that does not belong to the person calling? This happened here with the telemarketing charge card thing. At least four calls with the same recording. but the numbers were all from people in our town. This was reported to the people that the numbers belonged to and also to the police and the phone company. There is nothing anyone can do about it, The people whose numbers came up on the caller ID had no idea their numbers were being used.<br> So when someone claims to be from the ACS and the caller ID says Census Bureau, there is no way to really know who it is.<br> Also, the calls start early in the morning til late in the evening. Also on Sunday.<br> How are the workers paid? Salary? Time and a half? Double time? Does anyone know?<br> So what it amounts to is that we are paying to be stalked and harrassed and threatened.<br> Something is terribly wrong here. This too much resembles a certain period in time in the last century when no one paid attention to what was going on until it was too late.<br> I would imagine this web-site is quite well monitored by you know who!<br> Why do they want info that they already have?<br> Creepy!</p>

             <p>Great to find this site! Ive just had my 3rd visit from a census worker on 8/8/11. </p> 
             <p>Last year I answered the 2010 Census like most of you; 2 people reside here and mailed it back. Within a two week period in 2010 I received 2 in-person visits. I told the people I was not going to answer any questions other than what I was required to under the Constitution and asked them to leave. This Spring (2011), I get a phone message left from someone claiming to be from the Census and to call them back. Naturally, I didnt. Then last Monday this guy shows up and knocks at the door. He has a laptop and some kind of ID badge around his neck. I answer and ask Can I help you? He says hes so-and-so from the Census; as soon as I hear the word Census, I say Im not interested. and start to shut the door. He then comes out with, Well your obligated which is as far as I let him get. At this point my Irish temper is up and I respond, Im not obligated to answer any of your questions and you can go back and tell that to your boss Obama! I then shut the door. He goes back to his truck and sitting in my driveway, proceeds to begin typing in his laptop. Im starting to get a bit paranoid and start to think, Hmmm, what is this guy typing in? (probable Tea Party member, right -winger, could have lots of guns in the house, keep an eye on). So I go back out and ask, Is there some reason why youre still in my driveway? He say hes filling out paperwork. I tell him to go fill your paperwork out somewhere else and to get out of my driveway. He responds by saying, Youre kind of a troublemaker. I then tell him that I answered his questions last year, 2 people live here, thats all the answeres I will provide and tell him, Now, get out of my driveway. Which he does.</p> 
             <p>Today, 8/13, when my wife and I returned home from a very pleasant get together with friends, we find an official US Commerce envelope stuck in our door enclosing a letter explaining the ACS with a card from the Field Represenative in Boston asking me to call him so he discuss the concerns you have about this US Census Survey. Needless to say, I will not be calling. </p> 
             <p>Thanks to all the posters above and their experiences and advice, I will now be calling my State and National reps about this blatant harrassment, handing copies of your letter to them if they come back, and calling the Sheriff to escort off my property.</p>

             <p>Richard in Ohio  </p> 
             <p>Your grammar issues aside, the People have a right and a duty to be suspicious of their Federal level of Government. Our founders clearly understood the dangers associated with this style of governing and so they added numerous checks and balances to prevent it from becoming too monsterous. </p> 
             <p>Sadly, the Federal Government no longer thinks that they must abide by those checks and balances. This is partially due to apathy in the populace but also due to greed and power-grabbing. These paranoid people are merely putting their foot down; marking a line in the sand and finally saying, Enough is enough!</p> 
             <p>Its not paranoia  its called the Constitution and Supreme Court case law. Our government can not demand private information under threat of fine and/or violence without probable cause of a crime having been committed.</p> 
             <p>Get with the times, Richard.</p> 
             <p>Thanks for commenting, regardless.</p> 
             <p>Kevin Hayden<br> Founder, TruthisTreason.net</p> 
             <p>PS  I could certainly handle government services being stopped and be on my own. In fact, that would be my preference. I dont use government services and my ambulatory service is a private company, as it should be. Thanks.</p>

             <p>I dont remember when I got my acs but it was in my pile for an extended period of time. Ah, I think I lost it. So far, if theyve called, I didnt recognize the number on the caller Id and did not answer. So far no one has shown up at my door. Perhaps the 7 dogs and the fence around the front door are a factor.</p>

             <p>When I originally received the ACS I thought it was the 2010 census which I had already completed and so I threw it away  twice. Then I received numerous notices. Since August 2nd, Ive been called 10 times and 4 times they have managed to get to my front door  I live in a gated community. Yesterday at 6:20 pm, the census worker was banging on my door so hard that it was ratttling within the door frame. Between the pounding, he rang the doorbell repeatedly. Then slip his notice through my door. 5 minutes later, he was back banging on the door and goint at the doorbell with a fury. I will not answer the questions and I will never answer the door. They want to know information about my fertility and my marriage history  they are nuts if they think Im going to answer. They must get paid a high wage to get someone to comply  I cant think of any other reason why someone would be so persistant. And this morning while I was at work, my cell phone was ringing as he was at the gate trying to get in again.</p>

             <p>To Tina, hang in there you only have until the end of Nov.They are only suppose to harass you for 3 months. You can call the police and have them removed from your property. Then put signs of PRIVATE PROPERTY NO TRESPASSING on your gate and if they still are harassing you call the police and you can have them arrested. These people have to report to a supervisor and if they dont get anywhere with the people they are sent out to harass then it makes them look bad an their not doing their job.<br> You can disconnect the door bell so it wont ring and you can have his cell number blocked from you phone.</p> 
             <p>As for Liz, they arent going to fine you, if they did fine everyone who isnt cooperative with them that would cost so much money that they couldnt do it. They cant actually fine you unless they take you to court and that would be costly also.</p>

             <p>We received the two standard issue copies of the survey in the mail during the summer. They both went in the fireplace with the rest of the Occupant and Resident junk mail. We thought they were a joke! We never thought for a second that the government would in all seriousness be requiring such outrageously personal information for ANY reason. Then we found the first notice left at our locked driveway gate on the 10th of August. It was followed up with a phone message from the same agent three days later. My husband phoned her back and told her we would not comply with the survey. Her response was, Ok, thank you. The same day there was a second notice left at the gate from a second agent. Two days later, we got our first letter in the mail. After two more days, we got our Fed Ex delivery from a supervisor. Next came six more phone messages from yet another agent and another letter in the mail. Now with a new message this morning, the added twist includes mention of Title 13 threat and Wednesday for a deadline to respond. There was only the one personal contact by phone with the first agent. </p> 
             <p>We are a half mile from asphalt down a rough dirt road in an unincorporated and very rural area 32 miles from the nearest Wal Mart. Maybe that is why we have not suffered more attacks in person. With the warning to respond by Wednesday, we are wondering if the end of August means we will be cycling out of their crosshairs. Does the three months BEGIN with the first mailing of the survey or does the three-month ordeal start with the subsequent harassment? Anybody know?</p>

             <p>To Right Wing Extremist We got our first mailing at the beginning of April with a second mailing about 2 weeks later. Then in March is when the phone calls started, we never had anyone come to the house, but we were ready for them. Posted NO TRESPASSING PRIVATE PROPERTY SIGNS and would call the sheriff if they did go ahead and trespass. We shut off the answering machine so if they did call we didnt know it. Shut the ringer off on the phone and told family &amp; friends to call us by cell phone.<br> It is suppose to only last 3 months, so if you get your mailings started in say Aug, you should be done with harassment about the end of Nov.<br> Good luck and it will pass</p>

             <p>Thanks a bunch, Done! The first mailing must have been back in June, as the caller says surveys were sent the previous two months. We have always had the signage on the gate, keep it locked at all times and have instructed callers we would want to hear from to use the cells. Its a sorry state when a convenience we pay for (our land line phone) is usurped with maddening frequency by uninvited and unwelcome users who do so at the expense of our tax dollars. It took them no time at all to get the phone number for this Current Resident. We sure have a big problem with being threatened with monetary sanctions for trying to protect our privacy! But, like you and the other previous posters, we refuse to be intimidated by these goons.</p>

             <p>Got the note that they would be sending the survey last week. Today the survey showed up. In the 2000 Census I answered only the number of residents and for race I put, Appalachian American. They showed up computer in hand. I gave the same information to the guy that showed up. He read the riot act, blah, blah, blah. I refused to answer and he left. Got a letter from the IRS in 2000 requesting additional information.</p> 
             <p>I filled out the 2010 Census as outlined in the Constitution and they sent two more. I trashed each one. This ACS is going in the trash. Our county recently changed our addresses so the survey isnt mine because my name isnt Resident and they have the wrong street address. I cut off the landlines last year and only use cell phones. Land is posted and my two large German Shepherds will keep everyone in their car. My only concern is the IRS audit that may be initiated due to my desire of privacy.</p>

             <p>Thanks everyone for their comments. Over the past month or two I have received the 2 surveys and postcards, and now today received a flier and card in my door (I wasnt home for the personal visit). Have not received any phone calls at all but I do have an unlisted number so perhaps that helps.</p> 
             <p>I plan to take the advice, and send in the front cover, certified/return receipt, with only the number of people in the house and a copy of the above letter referencing the constitutional case. Alos will post a sign on the door and use a camera if necessary. </p> 
             <p>Well see what happens. I hope the 3 month window is correct because all the harrassment will be difficult to take.</p>

             <p>I spoke too soon. Got my second copy of the ACS a couple of days ago. It followed the first one thru the shredder. When they start calling, is it usually local phone numbers? Ive have a DC number and several unavailables repeatedly on my caller id. If I dont recognize the number, I dont answer.</p>

             <p>Im not sure if it applies in all states, but I know that in some it is against the law for someone to leave things on your door or on your property in general. So, if there is a contact name that has been left on your property you could check with local law enforcement and see if they can be notified that this is illegal.</p>

             <p>To Paranoid:</p> 
             <p>Seems not to make much difference either way. My husband returned a call early on in our adventure and informed the representative who had left a message that we would not be complying with demands for answers to the survey questions. Her response was, Ok, thank you, and they both terminated the call at that point. It was a polite but short conversation. That was on a Saturday afternoon. The phone calls started in earnest the following Monday. I have read that those who offer the least response get bothered the least. We made no other attempt to respond or otherwise discourage their efforts. We just kept the gate locked and NEVER picked up the phone. We have had no contact since the phone message of August 29th warning us that we had until the 30th to comply.</p>

             <p>Tonight I answered their phone call and told the guy one person lived here and that was the only question Id be answering. He then asked me, what?. When I said I tot I had been clear he asked me three times if I was declining to take the survey, answered, you got it, then 2 times asked if I was refusing. Id say thats what I was doing. No one must have told him people are against this, he sounded totally shocked. Supervisor next, I aassume, or do they start the visits right away?</p>

             <p>I received census forms last year in 2010 and I totally ignored them. They called a few times, I think they actually sent someone to my door for a personal visit. if I remember correctly a notice of some sort was left at my door; of course, if Im not expecting you, than Im not home. ? </p> 
             <p>Those people can eat my dick. I will not dignify them with a response. Just like everything else that means nothing to me, I ignore it: drug laws, taxes, etc. </p>

             <p>I recieved two American community survey forms two weeks apart and almost fell for the you are required to fill this form out spiel. After researching the topic on the internet I decided to throw them out. A few days later the phone calls started because I listed my number on the original census form that I filled out earlier. I repeatedly told the callers that would not be amswering any of their questions and instructed them not to call anymore. The calls continued then eventually a person showed up at my door and I told him I was refusing to participate. I then received a letter trying to convince me how important the survey was, how it was required by law. and how they really hoped Id comply. It also said that a supervisor would be coming to my residence. If the supervisor actually comes I will instruct him to get off my property. If he refuses he will be required to answer a few questons of his own on an arrest report. In our state (NY), if someone refuses an order to get off your property its called trespassing.</p>

             <p>In 2010, I was hounded by Census workers via phone calls (often twice daily) &amp; visits, which continued although I stated that I had no intention of completing th American Community Survey.</p> 
             <p>After receiving the actual 2010 Census, I completed the number of residents (only) &amp; returned it. I thought that was it, until it started again, in August this year.

We didnt respond to the door. Unfortunately our daughter drove up while she was at the door. My daughter told her not to come back. Today we received a letter and pamphlets by FedEx. We had emailed our Senator and unfortunately a member of his staff forwarded our email to the census bureau and we promptly got a letter from them. Maybe that was a big red flag. I feel that we have been harassed more than a bill collector would have harassed us. Is this the kind of country we live in? We are not sure what to do next.</p>

             <p>I sent my Census in late, and only answered the how many people were in the household. Later a census worker came and I told her I had already sent in the Census count, she replied they did not get it that is why they sent her out. I told her to go look again, as It was sent, she came back quite a few times.</p> 
             <p>Currently, I am being harassed for the American Community Survey. They sent me two and now after two census people came to my home with no success, have I received a letter from the Director of the Census, basically threatening me with a $100.00 fine. </p> 
             <p> I am going to print out this letter and mail it back. I am worried, if they apply the fine, what is your advice?</p>

             <p>I contacted the Rutherford Institute. They said that the Census Bureau has yet to prosecute anyone. They said to contact them if the Bureau employees call at unreasonable hours, come to your residence after dark, approach your residence from the back or sides, look in through windows, or take any other actions to invade your privacy beyond calling and coming to your front door.</p>

             <p>We received another phone call and visit. We decided enough was enough so we answered the door. Told her that I was only going to answer the questions I had answered on the census short form. She said OK . When she tried to ask additional questions, I said no.

             <p>I was a crew leader during Census 2000. Its all very unorganized and nothing to be taken too seriously. I scored high enough on the standard test to qualify for a crew leader job, where I taught a three day class to other people who just walked in off the street, and then I supervised and collected their work for a couple months. At first, any phone calls would be coming from the actual guy on the street They are trained to try and get ahold of them by phone after a couple unsuccesful visits. If they cant reach by phone, theyll try to get info from a neighbor. Failing that, it gets turned over to the supervisors. In the end, if the Census can get ahold of the basic information of how many people live there, thats the end of the story. We were trained to not make threats, but to just try to convince people that it was Constitutionally ok to ask the basic information. As much as I cant stand the government, the Census probably falls on the more benign and incompetent side of the spectrum. But that was 2000.</p>

             <p>You guys are a kick. Im so glad that 99.9999 and on percent of the American public in isnt weird and prone toward long, stupid digressions on Madison, Jeffererson and John Jay with endless quotes from them, the constitution and your brain dead legal sounding mumbo jumbo. The just get on with life, as you cant seem to do, and anwer the damn questions like theyve been asked to do. Sheep? Asleep? Sure, if thats your preference. But, youre just talking to yourselves; youre not getting anywhere and your a bad and stupid joke. Im a extensive user of census data and neither I nor any of my colleagues has ever thought to look up anything about anybody. Theyre not coming to get you based on what you put in the ACS questionnaire. Laughable; its just laughable. Have a good time, though. Oh, why dont you bring it to court? Or are they going to come and get you for that? Or, is something wrong with the court system, if youre so smart and educated on the constituion? Youll lose like youve lost already and will lose again. Keep up you own marginalization, fellas. The rest of us have things to do.<br> Lefty</p>

             <p>Thanks for the tip about the Rutherford Institute, terryo! I contacted them today.</p> 
             <p>Last night, around 6:30 PM, someone banged on my front door. I ignored it, as usual (although the Census worker had already been here, at 4 PM). As I was sitting in my kitchen, I looked over &amp; a man was looking in my kitchen window (not visible from the street  its located about 60 feet from the street side property line, between my house &amp; my neighbors  about 20 feet between the two houses). Naturally, I called the police.</p> 
             <p>The OFallon, IL Police responded, then Officer Klemco informed me that there was no problem  it was a Census worker! I pointed out that he was trespassing AND looking into my window. Officer Klemco stated that Census workers are exempt from trespassing laws AND that IL law states that if I dont want anyone looking in my windows, I should close my blinds!</p> 
             <p>Hopefully, the Rutherford Institute will enlighten the Census Bureau &amp; the OFallon Police Department.</p> 
             <p>Anyone have any other suggestions I may have for legal recourse?</p>

             <p>Reading all the comments in this post is refreshing, and confirms that U.S. citizens have backbones.<br> Since 2004, a direct relationship has appeared:  as the jobless rate increases, the invasion-of-privacy imposed by unelected government employees also increases. Because U.S. jobs are becoming so scarce in part by mis-directed government spending, citizens off the street are willing to fill ACS job positions that require willfully turning-a-blind-eye to carry out the instructions of unelected government employees and invade the humility, personal-security and private-affairs of their fellow citizens. All ACS workers get paid for their time, why dont citizens also get paid for their time if they so choose to fill out the survey? Fair-is-fair / a-scam-is-a-scam. ACS-workers / fellow-citzens you can do better.<br> Special interest corporations many foreign, representing a small percentage of total U.S. citizenship and tax revenue, benefit from the ACS budget, not the vast majority of citizens. The $150million a year ACS budget is primarily made of middle and lower class tax dollars, who would unconditionally benefit better if it were kept in their wallets. The ACS budget should rightfully land on the plate of the United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction [ Super-Committee ] slated as a portion of their goal of debt savings over a ten-year period.<br> Note: current federal policy includes ACS workers and U.S. Census workers in the posting of the jobless rate to make it look better; another reason this budget is available to the ACS.<br> Closing, I think both the constitutional response and the best response to the ACS is no response.</p>

             <p>Before I could read this information my husband wanted to fill out his portion just to see if the 38 min was correct. At least I had enough sense of mind just to give him a pencil instead of a pen. Then I got to the part about not defacing it and just returning it with the letter. Im glad it was just in pencil so I erased everything but you can still see certain important things.like his name. Should I still return it with the letter or should I just ignore it? I see from above comments that it seems people maybe are more hounded if they respond vs ignore it. Suggestions? Thank you all for your above comments and insights. I have enjoyed reading them.</p>

             <p>Reading through these complaints I would like to ask you this question. Do you think no government would be better. You are also so tuned in to making these poor census people who are only doing their job difficult. It is almost with delight that you like the repeating phone calls and continued waste of government funds that are acruing as you duck them. This is a huge country with very different needs and issues, that can be measured with reliable data. you have rights to not answer some questions, but come on, mre information is on your facebook page.

             <p>Thanks for stopping by and voicing your opinion, Nan. </p> 
             <p>I think you are mistaken. I do not take pleasure in avoiding the Census workers. Rather, it aggravates me, invades my privacy, and is a basic violation of private property rights. If my gate is closed, do not open it. If my fence says, No trespassing, that means everyone, including government workers with no credible reason to be disturbing me.</p> 
             <p>Its the principle of the matter. We could sit and write about specific instances or circumstances alllll day long, Nan. It boils down to the fact that they are threatening us with force, violence, fines, or threat of jail if we do not answer their questions. I am not a fan of State intimidation.</p> 
             <p>Are you? I dont care if the rest of the country benefits from my answers.</p> 
             <p>The rest of this country would benefit if I gave the Govt an extra $100 on my income taxesdoesnt mean Im going to do it.</p> 
             <p>Its principle. Its about standing up against something wrong, no matter how slight. </p> 
             <p>And regarding your JFK quote, when he told America to not ask what your country could do for you, that includes things such as entitlements and the receipt of Federal dollars  which are based partly upon Census figures.</p> 
             <p>THanks for stopping in and leaving not one, but two lengthy comments. I am sure that my Google ranking has ever so slightly increased, due in part to the length of time you spent on TruthisTreason.net.</p> 
             <p>Cheers,<br> Kevin Hayden<br> Founder, TruthisTreason.net</p>

             <p>I think the harassment for the ACS is aggravating my ulcer. But Id rather my stomach be eaten by acid then to comply with this b.s.</p> 
             <p>I called the guy that left his info in my door after ignoring all the mail requests, just to politely refuse since I didnt want to waste his time (and taxpayer money) and he threatened to put a lien on my home! Is this legal? Does anyone know if they really do that? This is my home and I work hard and pay my bills and taxes and dont commit crime! I thought this was a free country and the government couldnt terrorize its citizens?</p>

             <p>I just got my 3rd or 4th letter (after several visits to my front door) about the ACS and how I am Required by Law to participate. BS. If I get to be the first case to go to court, so be it. Rolling over to government intrusion is not the answer. If the average citizen (me) doesnt stand up, who will? Some have said hey, its just a survey. With the threat of fines for not answering? Make it voluntary, without the threats, and most folks (not me) would probably do it.</p>

             <p>Hayden,<br> Great website you have here. I went through this ridiculous circus earlier this year. Got the postcard, then the ACS, then the 2nd ACS. Did not get any phone calls due to an unlisted phone number. At the time, I started to answer the questions on my first ACS and became furious with the info that these jerks requested. A census worked visited my house after dark at which time my son answered the door. I told her that I filled out the census but WILL NOT fill fill out the ACS. Got a letter from Philadelphia a few days later and tossed it. A supervisor approached my wife in the back yard while I was not at home and told her that we could both be fined. She told him that I refuse to complete the ACS. Whole process took the 3 months and have not heard from them since (about 6 months ago).</p>

             <p>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! We are getting harassed over the phone for this. I will print the letter, and submit with the census. I found the questions much too intrusive. And just about every question is available to the government in some other agency. This is very helpful and thanks again!</p>

             <p>Appreciate this writeup. Ive been dealing with this headache for a little over 2 months. Didnt respond to the letter, then the pesky lady began showing up. A visit each weekend (honestly missed the first, avoided the second, avoided the third). The first two were accompanied with letters jammed into the door repeating the necessity of my compliance.</p> 
             <p>After the 3rd visit, within days (today) I received a more formal demand to comply to the ACS, stating that fines no greater than $500 could be brought against me. Now, Im no lawyer, but I looked up the Code that they refer to (Title 13, Section 182 and Section 225) and it didnt appear either applied to the ACS but perhaps the 10 year Census. They were also kind enough to provide me with a somewhat blurry copy of Title 13, Chapter 7, Subchapter 11, Section 223, which pretty much just details the Youll get fined $500.</p> 
             <p>Im looking to fight this myself. Originally, I just didnt want to answer the questions based on their overly involved nature, but now Im really interested in actually fighting this practice the more I read up on it. Ive read in a few places that there havent been any charges pressed against those who refuse (the Wiki on ACS suggests that they even plan for a small percentage to do just that) so Im not TOO worried about fines, but Id love to have a rock solid piece of literature to throw at them to cease their harassment. Your write up seems to be the ticket. Thanks for going through the effort to post this.</p> 
             <p>Hopefully others will continue to fight this overly invasive survey.</p>

             <p>Just received the first mandatory ACS survey today and instantly got that creeping gut feeling I get when Im being taken advantage of. My wife loves filling things out, but looking through the survey I quickly refused and began to Google the name of the form. Took a couple of tries, but here I am. Anyway, Im sort of stuck between three options: </p> 
             <p>1) Filling out the parts of the survey that seem logical and necessary, not including my name and any specific information about me and especially not my phone number; making sure to write Willfully Abstain in those sections that seems pretty cut and dry to me.<br> 2) Ignoring it completely and hoping for the best.<br> 3) Following this websites advice and sending a letter back.</p> 
             <p>My problem with option 3 is that it seems that those people choosing to do this option seem to get harassed the most. I have an anxiety disorder and a tendency to become physically aggressive when someone violates my rights, even if those rights arent legally protected The fact that I dont have a home phone and will not be listing any other phone number leads me to believe they will visit more than normal, and I dont like the idea of trying to quell a storm of rage when someone who is legally allowed to harass me tries to extract information from me. I know that they will be just trying to do their job, but I tend not to have a logical train of thought when someone steps on my toes. Threats just make me more angry and more aggressive, not scared.</p> 
             <p>Option 2 seems more plausible, considering there will be no number listed and my wife is literally terrified of any stranger, relentless of whether he/she is there in a legitimate capacity. My concern is that they may try and harass her while shes coming in/out and she will be both scared and willing to tell them whatever they ask just to make sure it never happens again. Yes, she has an anxiety disorder as well, but it edges more towards fear and not anger. Anyway, my concern with that is they will first harass my wife and then elicit anger from me without any ability to defend her, which is probably my greatest fear and the fastest route to a violent end in my book.</p> 
             <p>Option 3 seems like the obedient-but-guarded citizen route to take, but from what Im reading this will not stop them from trying to gain more information. Of course, it does make me feel better to be able to say that I complied as far as Im willing to comply and actually responded to more questions than I was constitutionally bound to respond to Just to me that seems like the most non-hostile, open, and friendly response I could give to our new big government survey. Seems like it would put me in the gray area where they would realize Ive done what I can to comply, am not trying to be difficult, and they have the information they need from me to know how to make an informed decision about the money they will be spending on their 3 million dollar toilets next year.</p> 
             <p>I need thoughts, though Why is sending a letter refusing to fill out this survey better than just ignoring it? Principal? I get that, I do, but in light of my emotional eccentricity, and my desire to stay out of jail for assaulting a government employee, is it particularly wise for me to ding myself on the supervisors radar as a difficult citizen that needs extra attention?</p> 
             <p>Actually, that perspective leads me to the conclusion that ignoring it may be the only viable option for me. Just like the attention-whore sitting up front and asking all of the questions: the less attention the room gives them the less they will speak. That seems both logical and socially sound.</p> 
             <p>I still have to consider the fact that I could just print out a copy of the answers I am willing to answer, as well as a willful abstention for the rest That way they get a little of what they need and not any of what I dont want them knowing like my name, that I have an anxiety disorder that makes me avoid confrontation and smile when Im actually angry, and that my job knows Im undependable about time and so I leave at different times every day and they just understand because I work hard when I get there really, there isnt really enough room to write all that anyway.</p> 
             <p>So again, what do you people think? Best route to take without divulging too much information or putting a big, red, flashing circle around my house?</p> 
             <p>Thanks,<br> XR</p>

             <p>xreplyFor whatever it is worth..I followed Haydens advice almost to the letter. Check my post of Aug 2. I received delivery confirmation on Aug 5. To date, we have not gotten one phone call or knock on the door. Maybe we are just lucky. I have a copy of the proof of delivery just in case someone shows up. Plan to just politely ask the person to please check their in basket and give them the copy of the proof of delivery. They can have more information when we are court ordered, and not before. Have talked to two attorney friends and they advised to make copies of government IDs presented so well know their names. Good luck. Hang in there.</p>

             <p>Thank you Hayden!! And to XREPLY, I completely understand how you feel! I googled Refusing the ACS &amp; found that I am not alone in refusing to be bullied with interrogative questions. I am another who becomes angry not afraid when pushed. I filled out the first part but as I read on, I too, Sent it in &amp; thought nothing more if it.<br> Two weeks ago, a man drove past our NO Trespassing signs &amp; up to the house. I opened the door as he got out of his car &amp; asked why was he there. He said he was from the Census Bureau (he showed NO ID of ANY kind) &amp; with an attitude of entitlement, began walking toward the house. I told him that I had already sent it in. Arrogantly he says, No you didnt. We just sent it out a few weeks ago. Now, hes called me a liar !! He continues toward the house &amp; I told him, Im NOT answering anything! I have an appt &amp; Im late. He said hed come back Monday @ 2pm. I said nothing&amp; walked away. We receive a card in the mail saying Mondays Columbus Day &amp; hed be here Tuesday at 2pm. I didnt answer. He left papers crammed in the door with a note to call. In the following ten minutes, he drove through our driveway several times,setting off the alarm each time. He stops again on the 12th, I didnt answer. No papers. Several days later, we receive a letter addressed to my husband (our names are on a door plaque) stating that HE had refused to answer this mans questions &amp; if HE did not comply that HE may be fined $5,000.00 &amp; supervisors would be making visits to the home &amp; urged compliance. The man NEVER spoke to or even met my husband !! Who is the liar ? I got angry. I came in &amp; googled his name. I found out that he had lien on his property for $34,000.00. He owed that kind of money to the goverment &amp; they think Id give him access to anything concerning us? Its been about 10 days since weve heard anything else..yet. I have questions for anyone that can answer. If it;s anonymous as some have claimed, why does the form have a bar code, why do they need your name &amp; how do they claim you did or didnt send it How is it protected by the Constitution when it says its a survey I say BS. Let me ask YOU a few questions &amp; see if YOU answer me!! Im fighting back &amp; if it comes to it, to court I will go!! Use a video camera if they come to the door, google their names ( you might be surprised what you find) &amp; ask them personal, invasive questions. Such as, so I understand you went to prison for embezzling almost $40,000.00 from a local bank &amp; now youre a supervisor for the Census Bureau, harassing me for information (true story).</p>

             <p>The harassment is unbelievable. When they come knocking they ring the doorbell, knock, rattle the door handle. Scared my kid. First thing out of the mouth was a flat lie. She claimed it was earlier than it actually was. Heck, she came at a time where I normally wouldnt open the door. She firmly demanded entry. Heck no! I shut the door in her face. More rattling the door knob and stuff. Then she stuck the envelope through the door. It isnt easy to do and it caused damage. </p> 
             <p>She left her name and number. Wow, dont they teach these people anything? I now know where she lives! Maybe I should come knocking at her door.</p>

             <p>I have been chosen also. So far Ive received two inquisitions and daily calls to my home phone. I have not responded or answered the phone (thanks to the screening). Often they leave a message, sometimes they do not. I have been assigned a case number. I probably should be expecting visitors soon. I was mostly apathetic and undecided on the next election.

             <p>I received this piece of trash in the mail today. Back in 2000 I received the long form Census form. I only answered the questions that are truly necessaryhow many people live in this home. The rest of the questions I wrote, none of your business. I got a visit from a lady that lives in our community. She was there to get the rest of the answers. I politely told her that I had answered all I was going to and there was no need for her to ask me for more info. She said Ok and I never heard another word. </p> 
             <p>Now I receive this form!?! These are the same questions I refused to answer before. My plan for now is thisI will show the form to my husband and tell him of my decision to refuse to respond. My act of civil disobedience. If I get another, I will also ignore it. I will not answer the phone to numbers I dont know and will politely say no to any house visitors.</p>

             <p>I got the letter with the survey in it today. Come to find out they wanted me to take it online. So i went onto the website and filled out how many people lived at my residence. When i got to the next question (cant remember what it was, i think my name) i found that if you leave it blank and click next it pops up with the You didnt fill something out error so i said what the hell and clicked continue again and it worked, it left it blank so long story short, gave them how many people lived at my address and submitted the form online.</p>

             <p>When the census taker came to my place she asked if it were my perminate resident? I said no, she didnt ask about any other place she said this was just her area, turned and walked away. I was pleased as punch sinice I do reside here and its a Year Round Campground. Your asking how ?? According to our contract when we signed, we have to leave every 60 days for 24 hrs. so that we are not a perminate resident. </p> 
             <p>Yes we own the land. We arent any where on any census. Yes ther are plenty of lots herebut be warned the water isnt fit for consumption with all the farm run offs of chemicals, cow patties, ect. and not all lots have a septic tank. The owner doesnt care &amp; wont invest in digging a deeper well.Only what he can charge &amp; spend else where. They lie out their arses to sell lots &amp; break every promise made afterwards.</p> 
             <p>I thought peace &amp; quite, it is when 2 of the neighbors arent home or asleep. I Guess thats one way of beating the Corrupt Government we have &amp; I have no problem with it . Between them &amp; Insurances we we have lost enough pay.</p>

Now i have a local census worker calling every other day, and yesterday a worker come by the house and left a card and brochure. I have been ignoring all calls!</p>

             <p>Got my second form a week or so ago and my first phone call tonight! My heart was pounding fast but I knew I wasnt giving in! She asked if I received the form and I said that I did. She asked if I completed them and returned them. I said I did not. She said I could complete it with her over the phone right now or some other time and I said I wasnt going to do that. She asked me if I realized it was mandatory. I said no its not. She said yes, it is. I said no its not. This went on once or twice more until I said are we done? I think she said yes and I said goodbye and hung up. I dont have caller ID so I cant tell when they call so any advice for what to do next time? I printed out some pages from this link so Ill have them close at hand. I could read some of it to her or just use it for reference while I talk to her. Or once I find out its the Census Bureau should I just hang up? I bet the in person visits will be even funner. Yipee!! Cant wait to see big government up close and personal. ?</p>

             <p>I was one of the lucky few to get the chosen for the ACS. I refuse to fill this out!I never replied and got another one. I did nothing. Later, a census woker came to my house and I wasnt home. My wife was and didnt answer the door. They came again and respectfully said I was not going to participate. She asked why and I told her the questions violate my privacy, etc. This went back and forth. I was always respectful and said I know she has a job to do and this was nothing person, etc. A told her I am aware of the penalties of refusing to do so and that she would need to do what she had to do. The only question I did answer is that this was my permanate address and that I will not be moving anytime soon.</p> 
             <p>I fully expect another vistior in the future. How far has this been taken legally?<br> Has any ever really been fined for this? I am willing to fight this to the end.</p>

             <p>I now can count myself as another American you must justify his right to privacy. I have received the 2 mandatory forms in the mail and received a Sunday visit from my local field rep, too bad I was not home. The very Next day the field rep decided to show up at my house when my wife was t home alone. She did not give him any information other than you will need to speak with my husband who will be home sometime after 7pm. We went to to run an errand missed our rep again! He left another card and note stating he would be returning to my home the next day or following one. I did some quick research and call him from an unpublished call center number ( not mine :)) . I would not give him my name, only the address he had on file. I let him know I would prefer that he not return to my property again. He then tried to get the survey completed over the phone. I explained that I would not be filling out any survey as I did not believe in the legality of it., I Told him I would choose to my right to stand on the 4th, 5th and 9th amendments, I then wished him a good day and end our phone call.. I wonder will he still show up? I advised my wife if he come on the property request that he leave , or call the local Sheriff office and have him escorted off the property. Ill post more when we see what happens in round three</p>

             <p>Several weeks ago I received my ACS in the mail. It was addressed to resident so it immediately went into the trash with the rest of the junk mail. A little while later came the threatening letter and the second survey. Deposited in the same account. About a week ago there was a card left on my door asking me to call the field rep for my area. I did not. On Monday, another card was left on my door suggesting that if I had any questions about the ACS I could call one of the listed numbers. I had no questions. Tonight I had my first face-to-face encounter.</p> 
             <p>The lady knocked on my door at around 7:58 PM (did not think they were supposed to make house calls after dark?). I decided to face the issue directly. After a couple pleasantries, she stated that surveys had been mailed to me. I said, yes mam. She continued, have you returned them? I said, no, mam. She asked if I was going to return them. I said, no mam. She asked, do you know according to the law you have to return the survey? to which I replied, I know that the U.S. constitution only permits you to do a headcount so I will tell you that there are two legal, U.S. citizens at this address.</p> 
             <p>At this point she said she could work with that, flipped open her laptop and asked for my name. I told her, that information is non-essential. She said she would enter the info as male at my address. Then she asked if the other person was male or female. Again, that information is non-essential. She must have figured out she wasnt going to get much information and asked me if I were going to answer any more questions. I said, no mam. She didnt press the issue but asked me to say that I was refusing to answer more questions. I told her that I would refuse to answer any more questions. She informed me that her supervisor may want to follow up with me in the future. I said, yes mam and she left.</p>

             <p>I got all the notices and 2 visits from the census woker. I told him I was not participating. His supervsior came out and left some propaganda at my door along with a card to call. I called back with an anonymous number and repeated that I will not be participating. He asked me if I was aware of the fine up to $5,000. I answered yes.

             <p>Unbelievable Government intrusion.<br> The census lady just left my property. I live about 7 miles back from the main highway (which is 21 miles from any main town) all dirt road and washes to my property. My nearest neighbor is 0.5 miles from me.<br> The Census knocked on my door. Which means the census disregarded my NO TRESPASSING sign and drove on to my property and up to my house. I live on 40 acres mind you. When i answered the door she flashed her ID and started to introduce the Survey she was here to conduct. She asked if I got the letter she left on my gate, It must have blown away I said. I asked her if this was Census, she said it was the community survey. I told her that there was 2 adults that lived here and that is all I was going to provide. She was persistent and kept trying to get me to invite her in for a survey. I told her that I will not answer anymore questions. She said I could use a fictitious name, I stated to her that would be fraud, are you asking me to commit fraud to conduct your survey? she said nothing in response. She then said that you can refuse to answer the questions I just need to ask them, she said she had a job to do and I was required by law to take the survey, so I told her that I refuse to answer all the questions no need to ask them. I asked her what law requires me to provide other information and she stated the Constitution requires me to. I asked her to show me her law because I know the constitution and there is no law requiring me to tell you my date of birth or name, and she looked through her bag of tricks and found she had nothing to show me the law with, guess she forgot it.. She then insisted it was to help my community and she stated and I quote Its clear you dont give a rats ass about your community, but.. I exploded. How dare you come on my property and insult me. I am a minister and I help my community and we help ourselves. I told her to leave my property and she refused. I told her I would call the sherrif to remove her, she said go ahead. Then she told me, and again I quote you obviously dont know your scripture, it tells you to obey the law. Well I was done, I refuse to entertain this women anymore. I gave a final plea for her to leave my property. She then drove off my property and sat right outside my gate for 15 minutes before driving off.</p> 
             <p>Now this experience brought me to find this site while looking for the government complaint line. (LMAO government complaint line.) </p> 
             <p>The angry me says ..$!@&amp; ^$#% @^$%*<br> But I am a man of moral and ethical principles. The Constitution is the law. and it is very clear and my loyalty is to it, and I will not bend. Its called Integrity.<br> I have every bit of mind to hold someone accountable for the intrusion of the federal government onto my property, and the insulting comments of the federal government towards me.</p> 
             <p>I am mad as hell.</p> 
             <p>I support your initiative Hayden. and thanks for the supporting information.</p>

             <p>We have had 2 copies sent, numerous phone calls, some with requests to call backwhich we did not. Someone came two weeks ago, to which I politely responded we do not have to fill it out and would not sit down and fill it out with him. One came again today, I guess, b/c he/she took the letter I printed from your site off the door on which I had written 4. We were outside in the back, but no one came around. My daughter said she saw he/she put something in our mailbox!!! She just now came in with a FedEx pkg from them that was on the driveway in the dirtguess it got blown off the table where the FedEx person put it. I would attach the letter to the form, but my husband started filling it out before we realized what we were doing and info we were putting on there. I hope this will suffice and they will leave us alone!!</p>

             <p>why dont you come up with a form letter for people to send to their representative and senator to the US Congress? when were looking for ways to save money, a zero budget for the census bureau for the nine of ten years without a census would fix this incursion into private lives pretty quickly.

             <p>Just received my second ACS addresses to resident of and my address. Also got a postcard in between the two surveys. I may use the template cover letter (above) and return their latest attempt, or may do nothing and wait..just for fun.</p>

             <p>I read somewhere in recent weeks about a US Senator or Congressman who tried to submit a<br> bill to restrict the ACS in 2009, I believe. It got nowhere fast. Do you know who this is? Id like to<br> urge him or her to pursue it again, as well as my own representatives.</p> 
             <p>My journey with the ACS started in mid-Sept. with the announcement letter. I received 2 copies of the<br> survey, one at the end of Sept. and one at the end of Oct. Since Nov. 2 Ive had 7 phone calls. In mid-Nov.<br> I found your web site and used your template letter to return my unanswered survey. I told the 4th caller<br> that I would be mailing the survey on a certain Monday and that she could stop calling now. Her<br> response was that they had to keep calling until they received the form. The 5th and 6th calls were on<br> a Sat. and Sun. on the same weekend. I told both that I mailed the form and the date it was mailed.<br> Here again today the 7th call. I told her also when I mailed the form and was told that they hadnt<br> received it yet. I said it wasnt my problem and to ask the people in IN (the return address on my<br> survey) to look for it. So far, no personal visits. But, I did receive the long form Census in 2000 and<br> completed only the questions asked on the short form. 2-3 months later, with no phone calls or<br> warning, 2 women showed up at my BACK door knocking furiously. I gave them the same response<br> about invasion of privacy, etc. and they said they would go if I answered one more question, so I<br> told them how many toilets we had in the house. The nerve!!! This time  absolutely no additional<br> information.</p> 
             <p>Thanks for this most-informative and helpful website!</p>

             <p>Thank you for this information. I am sharing it with anyone who will listen or needs to know. So far, Ive received phone calls (on my unpublished cell phone). Not sure how they got that number.some random selection they said. Then I get the American Community Survey in the mail. I did not reply. Now a second arrived in the mail. I will follow your advice and I thank you for helping to ease my worry about how I should respond. I must protect my right to privacy and it really bugs (being polite) me when the government tries to stick its ugly nose in it. God bless you, and God bless America.</p>

             <p>I had not received a buffer letter informing me that I was going to be receiving a survey from the ACS. It all just showed up together . The survey , the buffer letter as well as a colorful pamphlet with a guide. I seen the block where it said  your response is required by law and felt a sting of  no its not run through my brain. As I browsed the survey, I knew I had to crack my knuckles and begin my research for my official response. Thank you for the well laid out information . I have duly noted the many key parts.</p>

             <p>I received my buffer letter late last week and almost tossed it in the trash because it was addressed to resident of. I decided to search online a bit first and am so glad I found this site. The ACS form arrived yesterday and I was stunned by the intrusive nature of the questions  a total invasion of privacy. There is no way I will answer them. I tend to be pretty high compliance but this is simply beyond the pale. I am a little nervous about the potential consequences but it is time to take a stand before all of our rights are surrendered to this out of control government. I will respond with the letter above and post again as events unfold. Thanks for this valuable site.</p>

             <p>We received our first form to fill out on October 5th. We received a second one maybe 3 to 4 weeks after that. All of November up until Thanksgiving we were called by the CB at least 3 to 4 times a day. We never answered the phone and never called their messages back.<br> Today December 3rd we got home to find a note in the door from a CB worker saying they will be coming back.<br> I am nervous about the face to face visits. I will only answer how many people live in our house and nothing else.<br> I have two little ones and am home by myself a lot. So really wonder how this will go down. If we are inside I just plan on not answering the door. If we are outside I will only answer how many people live here.</p>

             <p>Got a letter last week and the big form today. Thank goodness this site is here. The questions are too intrusive. I answered 2 for the number of people that live here then wrote refuse on all the other ones. Put it in the return envelope, sealed it and sent it back. I expect to be left alone, I will post if they start bugging me. </p> 
             <p> By the way, what does my name, if I have a toilet, how many rooms in my house, have to do with my number of elected officials?</p>

             <p>Received the buffer letter, then got the survey. Very intrusive questions. I read the Title 13, United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 141 and 193 that they reference as their law that requires us to fill out the form. It does not state that we are required by law to fill out this survey. The only information I could find that we are required by law to give to the census bureau is the number of people that live here. I already gave that info in the 2010 census. I will give that same info to this survey so I am not violating any laws. I will post again here if they dont accept it and start to harass me.</p> 
             <p>Thank you for this site, and God Bless this Republic!</p>

             <p>I just did one of these in June and then about a week ago, they sent me the buffer letter and then I got the survey in the mail a few days ago. I am so angry at the questions. Whose business is it what race I am, what my ethnicity is, how much money I get in a month. Im not comfortable giving out any of that info to anyone. And Im angry I have to do this again when I sent it in June. And their new letter says I was randomly picked for this again. Honestly, I wish I could just call them up and tell them to go screw off. Im physically ill, disabled and in alot of pain. Im not up for making waves and fighting them. But they dont belong bugging us with this crap. Its a creepy racist survey that is far too intrusive.</p>

             <p>I received the card without the surveys the other day. I have received no surveys yet but I called the number on the card and they told me that they couldnt send out another survey but could conduct the survey over the phone. I do not want to do this survey. I have not had anyone come to the door yet but I keep getting an 800 phone call that when I answer, no one responds on the other end although I repeatedly say hello. I would like to know how many people are complying with this survey and how many people are as angry and feeling as invaded and threatened as I do.</p>

             <p>Got the buffer letter and survey a couple of months ago. I read through it and thought there is no way I am giving this level of information to anyone. I threw the form away. A couple of weeks ago, I came home to find a pamphlet and card from a CB taker. I called her. She wanted to come by when I was home to talk to me about the survey. I told her that I would not respond to it that Ive already been the victim of identity theft and I no longer give out any personal information unless its absolutely necessary. I asked her if I could be punished under the law and she said no. But that if I didnt comply at least partially a supervisor would come out (whatever). She came by a few days ago when I wasnt home. Spoke to my daughter who told her nothing. She came by again this evening around 6pm. I told her again to stop bothering me and that I would not be responding. She again said that a supervisor would be contacting me. (again, whatever). Im really glad to find this website because when they come back, I will simply tell the how many people live in my home and nothing more.</p>

I am going to return the form with a letter as recommended using the template.

             <p>I too have had the 2 surveys, perhaps phone calls (I dont pay attention to 800 numbers), and a visit from a field officer. He knocked but we didnt hear him, and he left a brochure and a request to call.<br> Im not a teabagger nor a libertarian, and have participated in the census with no qualms, but this survey is outrageous. I read it in disbelief. Not only do I not have the time to sit and fill it out, but every fiber of my conscience tells me not to share this level of personal information. I would even go so far as to fill out most of it without my name, but they seem to want all or nothing. So its nothing.<br> Thanks to the author of the website! I will print out the cover letter and send it in with the survey. Thank God I live in Vermont with sane and progressive representation to whom I may turn if threatened with a fine. And I hope everyone keeps posting updates.</p>

             <p>We just purchased this place Oct 28 as a weekender only home and this past weekend the pamphlet and the letter regarding the ACS was left with the CB reps business card and a hand writtern note stating she needs to hear from us right away as this is a mandatory census and your federal deadline is here and to please call so she can return and or take care of by phone. Since this is not our permanent address it will be interesting to hear what she has to say when I call her. The form letter states the address was chosen and not me personally. Interesting since I received the same survey at my permanent residence maybe last year and after researching and many phone calls from them I finally answered and said the Constitution doesnt require me to fill this out and hung up and never heard back.makes me wonder are they going about this a new way???? Will let you know the response. Also this property is marked no trespassing and she did it anyway..AMAZING!</p>

             <p>Thanks Reno,</p> 
             <p>I looked at that survey and it is the 2005 version which is a bit different than the one I received. However when I searched for ACS questionnaire rather than ACS form I found the current one at <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/questionnaires/2011/Quest11.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/questionnaires/2011/Quest11.pdf</a>.</p>

             <p>What is it with this ACS  Husband has some debt, does anyone else who received this ACS have the same thing? Am wondering how they randomly choose people &amp; if so, why dont they go to the neighbors or someone else if you refuse to take it? They stand at the door &amp; will not leave  isnt this loitering or harrasment!!! Do they know that the collection of data by someone who lies is not really accurate data??? I was informed fine is $100, by my attorney son. Also this is confidential to your name but can use this by your address as information  it is public access! Am angry &amp; feel we should have a right to refuse. Census B needs to choose people willing to take survey so it is an accurate census, after all isnt this the point?.</p>

             <p>I got both mailings and practically 2 times daily since November I get phone calls from the census bureau leaving messages or hanging up when I dont answer. My issue..first of all at first I had no issue with the mailing and started answering the form. Then, I started feeling bad about the questions asked and my feeling that these questions are too personal. So I quit! Most of the information they are asking the government already has and can look up on my tax forms. My other comment, how interesting that the government has the money and manpower to spend on this when they already have this information. I give it up each year so I can pay my taxes! I looked up my responsibilty as a citizen and other than my taxes which takes me forever to fill out, the regular census, which I cooperated with and now thisforget it! Plus, who has the time. I find this a waste of money and not fair especially since I am the only one in my neighborhood or family that has received this. Thanks for the heads up I will send your letter and see what happens.</p>

             <p>So, we had a visit yesterday. It was the second one and we were home. I gave her the print out that was provided up above on this website. I told her we would not be filling it out, but will answer how many people live here. She asked if I would answer the race question, I said no. She asked if I would give my name and the names of everyone living here, I told her no. She then said I didnt have to give my real name, I could just make up one. I explained to her that she was wrong, it is stated that you will be penalized for giving false information. She said really, they tell us in training to tell people they can give a fake name. You cant lie on a government document. So, then I said Merry Christmas and goodbye. It went fine. Im hoping that we are done with this. I did say to her at one point that our household is not answering these question so why dont they just ask someone else, since its random you know. She looked at me very strange and had nothing to say to that. ?</p>

I plan to have my spouse complete the second ACS we received so that she understands why we are declining to respond to the upcoming phone calls and personal visits.</p> 
             <p>You need to respond to these questions first-hand before you can fully comprehend their invasive nature. Dont be quick to judge if you havent tried to complete the ACS yourself.</p> 
             <p>I have a family and have been a technology business owner for the past 10+ years. I read stories about misused, lost and stolen information in private and government sectors on a daily basis. I value our privacy and refuse to contribute this private information to some confidential ACS database. Even if the CB did have a right to this information, they could never guarantee the confidentiality of this information.</p>

             <p>After I filled out and mailed in the acs with only my name and the number of persons living at my address, I recieved my secound call. I asked the person calling what her last name was, she answered then I asked what her address was and how many persons lived in her home. She replied that since she was a sworn federal employee she did not have to give me that info, I replied that If that is the case, I also was a sworn publis employee as I am a veteran and that I did not have to give her my info., as it was a direct violation of my consttutional rights. She said she would put me down as a refusal and she said goodbye. I contacted my Congressmans office and was told that he coud not reccomend thaI I break the law but stated that as far as they know no one has yet 2 be prosecuted. I stated that a lot of people are smoking pot in my state in direct violation of federal law with so called prescriptions and I resented that my congressman would put me in that category, as I have always been a law abiding costituent. I stated that I am no longer a law abiding constitruent as I would never comply with this Tyrrany.</p>

             <p>Larry, thanks for keeping us updated. Please keep it up. After two surveys, I am trying to endure the phone calls that are closing in on 60 or so with no information. ACS is excessively intrusive and government waste at its best.</p>

             <p>Hayden, thanks for posting the info. Ive been to other websites and its the same guys. Everyone has had it with this government. I got my ACS a few weeks ago and said no way. Called they and gave them the ACS # off the form and she knew my address. Like it was a coup for her. Big deal. Im not scared and Im not hiding. They are the traitors. I wonder what other ideas the planners have for us. You think maybe this will help with S. 1867? and the little thing about indefinite detention? Do I need help bathing? Is this to know if my house could be taken with little resistance? This is not good and I told them so. If you want the Constitution to say it, you have to get it amended. This is real simple. Not hard. The Constitution is an easy read once you learn some of the old english phrases (Corruption of Blood, my favorite). It says what it says and it doesnt say I have to tell how much I paid for homeowners insurance or my interest/dividend earned for the year. If you want to know how much I made, go ask the IRS and while youre there find out how much Oswald reported. Now, that might be worth something. I will tell I am ME. ONE. Its Christmas now. I bet January will be fun. I keep you posted.</p>

             <p>I have always been leery of posting a comment on any site, and never have  that is until today.</p> 
             <p>I, too, have received two copies of the ACS in the mail in recent months addressed to Resident. I ignored both of them, despite the ominous warning YOUR RESPONSE IS REQUIRED BY LAW. I have since had four visits from an agent. The latest being this morning at 10 a.m. (We had just spent an exhausting night Christmas eve wrapping the final presents, and Christmas day with family. We wanted to sleep in this morning, only to be woken by the intrusive and persistent ringing of our door bell three times  Talk about being invasive!! I looked out our bedroom window, and recognizing the car in the driveway, I did not answer the door.)</p> 
             <p>After the first visit, I read the questions on the survey. At the second visit, I politely told the agent that I found the questions to be intrusive and that I was not going to answer them. The third visit I ignored. This fourth visit was most unnerving. The note left on my door reads as follows:</p> 
             <p> Mr. **********: Your case will be returned to H.Q. for further action on 12/28/11. Fines for deliberate non-compliance can be severe. Please call me to avoid this result. Thanks!</p> 
             <p>I am so outraged by all this, that I have been moved to respond and to take action (as evidenced by this my first post ever).</p> 
             <p>I have just spent the past five hours on the internet researching this matter and found quite a bit of interesting material (including this site).</p> 
             <p>HISTORY LESSON:</p> 
             <p> 1. Despite decades of denials, government records confirm that the U.S. Census Bureau provided the U.S. Secret Service with names and addresses of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Source: Scientific American by JR Minkel March 30, 2007</p> 
             <p> 2. Washington DC, Jul. 30 (UPI)  The U.S. Census Bureau has given the Department of Homeland Security detailed demographic data on Arab-Americans, the New York Times said Friday. Source: Washingtontimes.com July 30, 2004</p> 
             <p>Despite these two cited history lessons, the U.S. Census Bureau continues to use lying as a means to extract information from American citizens (as well as using harassment, intimidation and threats of fines). The following is taken directly from the Handbook For Local Officials from the U.S. Census Bureau issued December, 2004 (page 6):</p> 
             <p> What if I am asked about the American Community Survey?</p> 
             <p> []</p> 
             <p> 2. Do I have to answer all of these questions? Yes. You should answer all of the questions. The survey is part of the census, and answering it is required by law (Title 13, U.S. Code). Give your best estimate for items that ask for detailed amounts. Your answers are anonymous.</p> 
             <p>Given that the first question asked on the survey for each person is their name, how can the U.S. Census Bureau claim that my answers are anonymous.</p> 
             <p>I found the following which may be of some help:</p> 
             <p>LEGISLATION INTRODUCED</p> 
             <p> On March 3, 2011, Congressman Ted Poe (TX) introduced H.R. 931 to the House of Representatives. H.R. 931 would allow most of the questions on the American Community Survey to be optional. If H.R. 931 became law, the only questions that would be mandatory would be questions on your name, date of response, contact information, and number of people living at the same address (similar to the information asked on the original census in 1790).</p> 
             <p>I am thankful for the suggestion on how to respond to the survey, as contained within this site, and I will act accordingly.</p> 
             <p>I will be contacting my U.S. representative in congress and ask him/her to support Rep. Poes proposal. I would ask all readers to do the same. You may reach your U.S. representative by calling the U.S. Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121 or toll-free at 866-220-0044.</p>

             <p>OK, just got my 2nd copy of the ACS. Im enclosing a copy of the letter and mark one as James did. Im post later with phone and body count. If I answer the phone or door Im not going to ID myself. Ill just say a friend and Ill tell him. Lets see how many trips they are willing to make. Im told I will be fined. OK, so fine me. Why the threats? Rings hollow. I wont pay it. Are they going to place a lien against me with the IRS? If so why, dont they simple ask the IRS what I made last year instead of asking me? Maybe the ACS is BS and Census knows it. Well see.</p>

             <p>I just received this form today. I wonder if the people that fill out the original form a certain way are being targeted. When I filled out the original census the first time around, I filled out my race as American. I sent it in, and still a census worker showed up at my door. I was aggravated to have go through the questionairre again, but I did. </p> 
             <p>So I went through the census form yet againwhen census lady asked my race, I stated American. The census lady didnt like my answer. She asked my race againand I said, I am an Americanthat is my raceplease put that in blank appropriately. She was definitely frustrated with my short and quick responses, but I dont like this Orwellian crap.</p>

             <p>I believe the survey is a DANGEROUS invasion of privacy. Look, for example, at their medical/health questions. As is well known, anyone who calls us and asks those questions MUST be HIPAA certified. Are they?? Even the simple When was the last time xxx was pregnant? is a violation of HIPAA. THEY have no right to ask any of the medical questions on this survey which makes the whole document illegal under federal law.<br> We should not allow the government to intrude into our private affairs. If they want to know how much money we make they can call the IRS. The only question I will be answering, if any, will be the number of individuals living in my home. But I already answered it on the real census last year!</p>

             <p>Hi,<br> Im glad there is a place like this for people to share their thoughts about this outrageous and intrusive survey. Mine hasnt come yet, got just a notice that it would come shortly. </p> 
             <p>Interesting, a friend of mine told me that he did receive such survey some years ago, and he decided not to fight and just filled it out.

             <p>I am being stalked by the volunteer from the Census Bureau. I have had at least 15 visits and they have come to my door at all hours. I live in a restricted access community with clearly posted No Trespassing signs posted on the gate. Does anyone know if they are legally allowed to enter this property by following in cars or sneaking in on foot? Last night, a new volunteer visited my home. They were told that the door would not be opened and she said, well, you have opened the door in the past, why wont you do it now. I wonder what kind of detailed notes the first volunteer left for the next waive of assault? Then she said, I can wait here as long as it takes for you to open the door. This sounds like harassment to me. If this was a neighbor, or a random stranger I would call the police. Can I call the police on them for trespassing or harassment?</p>

             <p>I am being stalked by a volunteer from the ABS. Does anyone really believe these people do this for free? My home has been visited about 15 times. Yesterday a new volunteer arrived at the door. She was told the door would not be opened. She responded well you have opened it before, why wont you open it now? Im wondering what kind of detailed information my previous stalker passed on to the new volunteer. She then stated that she would wait out side as long as it takes. I am on my fifth document left on my door. I live in a restricted access community and a No Trespassing sign is clearly posted on the fence. These people are sneaking in on foot or tailgating a car to get inside the fence. If a neighbor or stranger was at my door continually, I would call the police. I wonder if I can call for trespassing and harassment on these people; and will the police come out for this problem? I feel like a prisoner in my own home, afraid to use my front door!</p>

             <p>So, I got this letter, than a lady from US Census Bureau shows up at my house and left her card, then I got two more letters and the lady showed up one more time. She called me several times reminding me that the survey is mandatory and I will get fined if I dont do it before my deadline!<br> Im sorry, but there is so much identity theft out there, I dont want her in my house, she a cheezy little business card, how do I know she is not taking video, or notes or electronically stealing information from me. I dont just talk to strangers or let them in my house. What are they thinking! I will know at midnight tonight..as that is my deadline.</p>

             <p>I have been harassed also. I put a lock on my gate and dont answer the phone, I have 1 month left before they move on to another victim .I love all of the information on this site. Another site that has also been very helpful is called notoacs, {Just say no to american community survey} Reading about other peoples experiences with this has empowered me to fight back. Both of these websites are great. Thank you Truth is treason for being here.</p>

             <p>Thanks for providing all this great information. I started filling out the survey, then called my parents for advice. My dad immediately thought I was being scammed. Everyone is right, the ACS is way too intrusive. I will use the draft letter to mail in. I am wondering if anyone that has refused to answer the survey has actually received any sort of monetary fine? Or any other types of threats?</p>

               <p>Same here, Julie. I received the survey a couple of months ago, received a letter, then a postcard. Then, 2/29/12 I received my first door knocking census taker. Because I was still sleeping with my white noise fan on, I noticed a business card with Please call me written on it taped to my front door. Hmmm.. nah. </p> 
               <p>When will he be back? Two people live in this household. That is all I am required to give them, correct? Supposed fine is 100 bucks still?</p>

             <p>Its a new year and the big push is on. I also received this Survey in 2010/. I provided my name address and a referral to find any further information on the regular 2010 Census form. Now with the new year I have received some calls and recently been informed that my case will be referred to a supervisor. </p>

             <p>I have received about 3 or 4 letters left at the house. Then yesterday I got an OVERNIGHT DELIVERY package from FedEx from them!!! How much money are they spending on this!</p> 
             <p>I have had the letter shown above ready to give them, but I dont think they are even knocking on the door. One of the envelopes I got about a week ago looked to have been opened by someone else and then put by my door. Must have been delivered to the wrong house.</p> 
             <p>Im just going to mail the letter to the Denver main office (Im in Colorado Springs). Looks like they are getting pretty serious now if they are using overnight delivery. Ill have another copy of it here in case they stop by.</p>

               <p>Hey Tom, I went and called the number and told them we have 2 people residing in our home. That was all the information Im required to give them. Using Kevins advice, I memorized most of what Kevin gave us. They left me alone. However, be prepared the person I spoke with was real nasty. I gave it right back to her. Those calls are recorded so jot down the time you called, just watch Ps and Qs but dont take no crap either. The rep said she was going to fine me its some time, havent heard anything from them. Stand firm on your rights and the reason the survey was generated in the first place. Hope this helps, definetly understand the frustration. Ironically, we pay to have this done to us through taxes. So sad. Toni</p>

             <p>Hello Again Kevin:<br> It has been sometime since I wrote to you regarding the Census. I thought this would tickle your fancy so if you dont mind Id love to share it with you. I did however get the Census Dept to leave me alone. With much appreciated advice from this web site. We participate in Farmers Markets. Today I received another Census. 2012 National Agricultural Classification Survey. YOUR RESPONSE IS REQUIRED BY LAW. The (NACS) is required by law. If you do not reply, you may be personally visited or you may receive a telephone call. I have to Feb. 3, 2012 to respond. So now I will modify a copy of your letter and send it along with this census. What do they think of when they send these rediculous forms out. If we comply, these agencies will continue to infringe upon our rights and privacy. Toni</p>

                 <p>Just wanted to say a big thank you to Kevin for this information. I only wish I had seen your site before I partially filled out the surveys. My husband and I sent them in and we have been harassed by telephone TEN times now. Last night I took the phone from my husband and of course, they cited title 13. I told them I would seek legal advice before I would answer any more of their questions. I will follow the link now to sign the petition online.</p>

             <p>As I was reluctantly, and finally, filling out the ACS, I reached the question of how much child support I receive. Why? Also, why do they need to know how many times I have been married and the year of that marriage? And why does the government need to know if I am physically able to walk down my hall? LAUGHABLE! At the child support question I decided that I wasnt completing it!!!</p> 
             <p>I am curious how they are getting peoples phone numbers? I use a prepaid service (StraightTalk  wonderful and cheap!) so there is not acct to link to me. </p> 
             <p>If they would like to drop by, they will be sorry. I will tell them to hang on and I will jump in to some revealing lingerie, heels, mess up my hair, pop open a beer, then invite them in. (Too bad I quit smoking 4 yrs ago-hence the weight gain :(-but maybe I should have a pack handy to light up for them?) I am 48 yrs old, 54? and 180 lbs so it wont be pretty. I will shout back towards my bedroom, Hang on, babe! Ill be back in jus-a-minute! Sounds like funI hope a volunteer will visitjust to see him (I hope) or her squirm!</p> 
             <p>But, how do they get your phone number???? Scarey!</p>

             <p>Would love to know what you find out Kevin. Please keep me posted. The form has about 5 questions on the front page. If you answer no to any of them they will update thier records. I personally feel by doing that you feed the enemy. That gives them a right-away to persue any other questions they feel like obtaining. Just not willing to submit to thier demands I guess. Should we? Toni</p>

             <p>Ive had the census worker constantly harassing me they called and called and called and finally got through I refused to answer the questions and he went into threat mode re: fine and the fact it was law. I ended up hanging up on him since he became extremely rude. Theyve left numerous notes and business cards on our door. He got my wife twice but she told him I was not home (truth) and they I wasnt going to answer the questions. He said hed be back every night till I was here. I called today told him I refuse to answer and said Id only answer how many people live in the household which he stated was useless information for him. He said he would come by my house tonite and again I told him I would refused and if he showed up Id call the police. He told him hed inform his supervisor and that hed probably drop by.. How can I get them to leave me alone. Theyre starting to scare my kids.</p>

             <p>My next-door neighbor received this survey in Dec. 2011. She did not respond. Then Census workers started coming from Jan. 7 and kept coming almost every night for 10 days. One time 5 people came. They were very aggressive to knock her door and windows. They also started knocking other doors of this apartment. (No one answers, though.) The neighbor was stressed out and decided to move to a motel. Also, she and I went police 3 days ago and asked him if hey could stop the workers harassment. The officer said they would and told us to call them. Last night, I called the police as soon as the workers started knocking our doors. Different police man came and asked the workers to leave. BUT, the police man came to me and said that the workers were doing what they were supposed to do. We have to follow their request. I said him he did not understand what this survey was and how the workers were harassing us. BUT he said just tell them to leave because this was not an emergency. My neighbor decided to move. Why do we have to suffer for this? I was happy to immigrate to the US for its possibilities and freedom. But now, this is like a communism country!</p>

                 <p>We also received our ACS in December 2010. I ignored it until the second copy came in the mail the week after Christmas. Upon opening and review, I was extremely concerned about the type of information requested and overall the general intrusiveness of the whole document. My husband and I decided not to participate. The phone calls began in early January, and we have begun to keep a log, including name, time, phone number and state of origin of the calls. All the calls come from either Indiana or Arizona and do not have a company name or identify the U.S. Census on the caller i.d. The calls have become increasingly more rude and I have noted a tone of hostility in the voices of the personnel. We have been completely polite with the callers and at the beginning of each call we have informed the caller that we have decided we will not participate in this survey. I have written e-mails to our state senators (Massachusetts) and to our local congressman but have not heard a response from any of their offices. My husband and I are not radicals. We pay taxes, we vote and we have participated in the 2010 Census as required. We will not be participating in the survey, and I encourage everyone who has received it to hold firm in their convictions.</p>

I too plan to print and include your form letter. Thank you for your work on this.</p>

             <p>Im being harassed to complete the UN-American Community Survey too. To be honest, I didnt even open the letters I received from the Census Dept because I completed the 2010 fully (granted, I put down Human when they asked for my race, and American when they asked for my ethnicity, etc, etcbut stillI answered it fully and honestly).</p> 
             <p>Then I started getting the nasty notes left in my mailbox by a Census worker. I ignored those too. Then one night, sitting at home, my phone rang. It was a local number so I answered it. And lo-and-behold, it was the creepy Census worker calling from his HOME phone number. He informed me that he had dropped by my house the day before and shown his badge to my roommate. By this time, I was pretty sick of all of this. I asked him how he got my phone number. He said that my CELL PHONE NUMBER is public record and he obtained it from City Hall. I figured he got access to it through the citys utilities department or somethingsomewhere, somehow, I put my phone number on a form that was filed in City Hall, and Mr. Creepy swooped in and swiped it. </p> 
             <p>Anyway, I was tired of this so I decided to be EXTREMELY cooperative (in my opinion) and answer questions that the government already knows about me (Im a veteran, so it has the goods on me). He had my name and phone number of course. I (stupidly) gave him my birthdate. Then he wanted to know how many people I have living with me. I told him I have two roommates. Then, he wanted all of THEIR information. I dont know about anyone else, but Id be really upset if one of my roommates gave out private info about me to someone else, so I told him I couldnt provide him with anything else about them. He tried telling me he needed this info. I told him, Look, I KNOW I dont have to provide you with ANY of this information aside from how many people I live with. The guy admitted to me that this was true, but that it would be so beneficial to me to provide this. He made up fake birthdays for my roommates and then he went back to questions about me. I think the only other info I gave him about myself was that I was a veteran. Everything else I said, I dont feel comfortable disclosing that information. He started getting frustrated with me and dropped hints that he didnt think they would accept that as an excuse. After my lack of answers, he moved back on to my roommates. I tried doing the same thing there, and finally he got fed up and said that he was just going to mark me as non-compliant and that I should expect a call from the legal department in Colorado.</p> 
             <p>Today I got a call from a weird number and didnt answer it. I got a voicemail stating that I should call the phone number left to me in the message. I just deleted it. Im going to try to keep dodging their calls, and if I DO happen to hear from one of them again, Im just going to request the form (telling them I refuse to answer any more questions over the phone) and take the advice of this site and return it with the cover letter.</p> 
             <p>I feel seriously harassed and threatened by this. I, too, have wondered if those of us refusing to comply are going to be audited by the IRS. I pretty much guarantee that were going to go on some watchlist somewhere (if we arent already on oneI, as a veteran, am Im sure). Oh well and so be it.</p>

               <p>By the way, has anyone else wondered why, all of a sudden, this survey is going out to 250,000 Americans every month? Gotta wonder if its for the creation and preservation of those jobs Obama has pulled out of his hatjust sayin.</p>

             <p>The collection of statistics is a useful function to the American People. The US Census Bureau crossed the line from statistic gathering to intelligence gathering when it began collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Power to interrogate law abiding citizens can only be granted by a Constitutional Amendment and the vote of the people. Unless the US Supreme court reviews and upholds those statutes, no one should provide any type of PII to anyone. The Supreme Court should rule that the American Community Survey is illegal and instruct the Commerce Dept to eliminate all PII from its databases. Just as mail-in ballots avoid PII, the methods for statistics gathering should be no less stringent.</p> 
             <p>I have combined an adaptation of Haydens excellent refusal cover letter, excerpts from citizens testimonials regarding harassment, a copy of the ACS I found online and mailed it to the Editorial Directors of the nations 25 largest news agencies. I have also purchased 50 bumper stickers that say: Google REFUSAL American Community Survey as a down payment on my childrens liberty.</p> 
             <p>Homeland security and emigration control are important issues; however, the people working them cannot be allowed to trample upon our Constitution. We all know that it was just this type of information gathering that allowed the German government to carry out its atrocities in 1935. Although its hard to imagine that happening here, there are other abuses that are easy to imagine such as phone, home, and work place harassment.</p>

               <p>The only legality the whole census is based on is the act of finding the number of humans living in an address. Statistics is not a valid function of government, certainly not one authorized by the defining document, the Constitution. Right there is a good line to stop at.</p> 
               <p>I see no evidence that justice will now or anytime in the near future flow from the Supreme Court. They are the unaccountable branch of government, put in place by other creatures of government, and they continually sell us down the river by conceding our lack of rights, bit by bit. Begging ones fraudulent masters is hardly the best way to maintain freedom, since you are begging the one who is intent on harming you.</p>

             <p>So let the games begin. Got the opening salvo back in the fall, the reminders in December, and now Im in the unlucky category of being harrassed by a CB contractor. A call at 4:15pm, another ACS form left, and then the doorbell rung at 9pm the guy must have piggybacked into my secure-access building. This is trespass under the County law.</p> 
             <p>In addition to a flagrant misuse of Title 13, the Privacy Act notice for the ACS documents a *completely* inadequate program for the protection/administration for PII information (Personal Identifiable Information). There is NO Security Classification for all this information, and in the notice (Federal Register, Vol. 71, No. 125, 6/29/2006, pp. 37039-40) they also ADMIT that the database containing this information is searchable by NAME and ADDRESS. My understanding (and I work with secured PII data in another area) is the databases MUST NOT have this data at the top, but should be converted to a system number that does NOT directly identify individuals.</p> 
             <p>And Im not even an attorney. They arent gearing up prosecutions for this because a) $100 fine is the only penalty authorized under Title 13;and b) they will lose BIG if this gets into court. I cant understand how or why this got by Commerce and Census Bureau Solicitors. GAO has also been critical of the ACS, and they havent done a D@mn thing to revise the survey (except for adding a line for SSN numbers HA!). </p> 
             <p>I will continue ignoring them and I know after 29 more days, they will go away. An informed electorate/citizens are their worst nightmare, and I will continue to live as a U.S. citizen with full rights and priviledges, which include not submitting to intrusive and dangerous requests from any Federal, State, or county agency.</p>

             <p>10 years ago, I declined to answer the questions on this form and was eventually harassed and stalked via phone and knocks at the door. They would also sit out in a car for long periods of time waiting to see if I might leave the house, retrieve my mail, etc. Over the phone I repeatedly told them that I declined to answer the questions, other than the fact that I  one resident  lived at this address. The Census worker then went to my neighbors homes to try to get information about me. I was appalled. I had to call a police officer friend I know who called the infamous Supervisor phone number at the Census Bureau and the harassment finally stopped. Fast forward to now, 10 years later and once again I am randomly selected to answer this survey? Like I believe that garbage? I am sending back my form, filled out only with a date and the number of people living at the residence, along with a copy of the provided-by-the-web-site letter. I am fully prepared to not answer any phone calls that I do not recognize, not answer the door (I never answer it to strangers anyway) and drop all my window blinds for what90 days? My previous experience with this was frightening and I am not looking forward to it again, but at least now I know what to expectthat said  this survey is a complete invasion of privacy and my rights. Taking a stand on this is a matter of principle.</p>

             <p>If you read the story, the CB folk were simply trying out threats to make Mr. Bolton reply. He has not be served any papers, and it seems there would have been follow up if there had been anything filed. CB has NO enforcement authority thats DOJs area, and they arent interested.</p> 
             <p>Very interesting that the CB supervisor was ENCOURAGING people to put false info on the forms. *That* is a big no-no. Just dont even play.</p> 
             <p>There are still no *documented* instances of prosecution. The $5k stuff is a load of BS. Title 13 has never been amended, its the CB trying to tie in a fine from a completely different statute. Title 13, as of 2011, still caps noncompliance at $100 by Congress. *That* is just one of the reasons they havent prosecuted anyone (since 1996 this is a Clinton II idea here people). So theyre going for *persecution.* The other reasons involved having lots of light shining on this little project. The more you look, the worse it gets.</p>

             <p>Was audited after a run in with a census worker over the phone. Made it clear that I did not like Obama or the intrusive questioning, that was in 2010. Got a notice a year later that Id been audited for the 2009 return (Im sure they also checked the 2010 return).

             <p>Ironically, Im teaching a Constitution class this year in our Homeschooling Co-op and Im going to use this whole experience to educate our kids on government overreach. Were going through the Bill of Rights lately and this is SUCH a learning opportunity! What would our Founding Fathers think of how big our government has grown? </p> 
             <p>Im going to show them the form I got, tell them about the phone calls Ive received, and then photograph and/or film any census workers that come to my door. They dont know who theyre messing withIve learned my Constitutional rights</p> 
             <p>Its up to us to turn back the clock on the growth of government. With a $15 trillion debt were going to have to cut back on some things. Id say this survey is a good start.</p>

               <p>I was outraged at the audacity of snoopiness into my personal life when I read the first one I got. Now, the 2nd one is using a legally threatening tone to coax me into submission.

               <p>HM, we homeschool, too. Dont you know those founders of public education are turning over in their graves? Students here in Oklahoma attend 180 days, 7.5 hrs/day and get free transportation to and from school. I dont think that is what was originally intended. I could rant about this for hours. (Buy that cake mix and turn in the proof of purchase for Box Tops for Education? How ridiculous!)</p> 
               <p>This survey is wasting so much money! I am closing my curtains and not answering my front door. A worker left a card on my door the other day. I may answer the door; depends on my mood at the instant of the knocking. Will only give # of people in household. They may pursue fining me, if they wish.</p>

               <p>All this prove one thing to me our beloved government has got so large &amp; out of control that the right hand has no idea what the left is do. They are using US to try to tie all our information together so they can have us all by the nose hairs. Many of the questions they ask are public information. The size our land, just Google our address and bingo you can see an view of our property as well as the house. Our cars are all have current tabs, look up how many cars we have. If I have been married more than once, the means there had to be a divorce. We pay taxes on our wages so they already know how much we make, we make our our income tax, so they know all our investments. Our social security numbers are all listed, that means they know when &amp; were we borne. IF you take a bus and buy bus passes, they are subsidized by the feds, all the passes have a bar code they they tell what time you leave in the morning, where you go and what time get off work in the evening &amp; how many days a week you work. If you have kids and claim them on your taxes they already know how many kids you have. They know if you pay for day care. I would guess that even know what kid of T.P. we use and how much. There are bar codes on every single thing we buy. That information is all collected to re-stock stores and who is to say who else gets that information. They are just trying to force us to pull all this information together. This is so scary for our children. Keep on educating and more important teach them to THINK.</p>

             <p>Im currently living as an expat in China for my work, and I am rarely at my home in the United States. I recently had my mail delivered to me by a colleague and found the ACS as part of it. After some grumbling, I sat down and started to fill it out. Then my grumbling became indignation and anger. What a crock! They do not need all this personally identifiable information. This is nothing but an invasion of my privacy as a United States citizen. Ironic that here I am living in China, and essentially left alone by the Chinese government, and I stand to be harassed by the U.S. government. Before pointing a finger at China for civil liberties issues, maybe we should clean up our own act first. I will not be sending back the ACS. Ridiculous.</p>

             <p>ACS taker would not stop harassment. It is true they send<br> 1. Pre-survey<br> 2. Actual survey form<br> 3. Post survey reminder<br> No repeat of survey form. Who is going to fill these kind of form who is clear form of privacy intrusion. It is a very good information for those burglars.<br> 4. Survey people come and visit your house, day and night several time including 7pm at night<br> 5. Multiple phone call following, esp for those who doesnt speak english, at random time day and night and as late as 8pm. Never left a message if got connected to voicemail.<br> 6. Threat letter comes through fedex overnight delivery (imagine what kind of waste taxpayer are doing??).<br> 7. Another survey person comes from Census bureau. Same person over and over again. Leaving another threat letter at the end</p> 
             <p>Unlikely this is over. Same census person, so called government worker, but only doing harassment to poor citizen. Is this called the great United States of America?? How would it looks to non-resident who just come and visiting, it clearly brought the image of the US down. </p>

               <p>Debbie L Elkinton just started coming by my house 3/3/2012. She stopped by that Saturday continuously pounding on my door for several minutes. She then came by again the next day Sunday. However I was in the back room and have no doorbell so I cant hear it unless im in the front. When I was reading this I had her card in my hand and noticed your warning about her. I now updated her card she gave me with the info you provided since it lacks her home number and her personal cell number. She lives very close to me apparently from the address you provided above. Most likely Ill find her waiting outside my house after work today sigh. Oh well let the games begin! Thank you for the info on this site and also for the info on Debbie. Ill be sure to be prepared for her.</p>

             <p>This is a follow-up to my January 27th post. Since then, we have recevied two personal visits and two more letters. My refusal to participate has now resulted in our being bumped up to need to speak to supervisor status. She called tonight. I firmly and politely refused to participate and asked (again) that the calls cease. We will see how much longer this will continue. My letters to my Republican Senator Scott Brown here in Massachusetts resulted in a useless e-mail reply stating how important and necessary the information collected is and to what good use the government puts it to. I find that highly amusing, given the sorry state of things currently. My Democrat Senator John Kerry never replied at all. I suppose that speaks to his character on its own, without further comment. We will continue in our refusal and I will be teaching my son a lesson in civil disobedience when Ms. Eileen Moore, Supervisor, ACS Census, comes to my door by having him video record our conversation and I think I may post it for all to see.</p>

               <p>I too, immediately wrote my congressmen. The results are on my blog. I was shocked by their responses. I am not an activist. I am an ex military nurse and was shocked by the survey and the responses by my congress people gave scared me even worse (Texas: Coryn and Hutcheson).</p>

               <p>I have not sent the form letter yet, but intend to send the letter next week when I get back from a meditative weekend. I have spent much time in prayer and meditation. Kindness and tolerance is very important to me as is staying calm and mindful of the good orderly direction which emotionalism does not give. It has been a difficult decision.This survey is not about finding those that dont belong here. It is about spending funds that we do not have to get information we already have. It is about abuse of law and representation. It is about violation of the constitutional rights. It is flat out WRONG. There is just no other word for it. </p> 
               <p>I am linking to this page. It is the only place I am finding information concerning this atrocity.<br> My heart and soul are indicating that I swore to the constitutionto fight all enemies foreign and domestic. </p> 
               <p>I will stand for what is right and true. Even if others do not.I am grateful to this site for at least giving me an option. I can not express my gratitude sufficiatly.</p>

                 <p>Thank you for your words, Mack. I checked out your blog and it is most certainly looks to be a great place in which you can rant and get your thoughts out! Thats sort of why I started THIS website, but then it took on a life of its own as a news and information outlet rather than just a place for me to scream and rant in.</p> 
                 <p>But, I find it soothing and mostly relaxing to type and write, regardless of the topic.</p>

             <p>Mr. Hayden,<br> I appreciate what you are doing by sharing your apparent knowledge re: constitutional law as it relates to the legitimacy (or lack thereof) of the American Community Survey. I, like many who have blogged here have followed your advice and mailed your form letter. I like many have begun to get the many phone calls (which I have ignored or since I have caller ID, just hang up on. However, I am concerned about how severe some of the harassment is for a number of your adherents and I am concerned how far it might get for me as I have a wife and 2 children. I did not see that you responded to Greepers cry for help as the harassment was getting so bad for him.<br> This could get quite serious for a number of us if we continue to down this path that you are advocating.<br> Personally I would like to know if there is any bona fide legal challenge to this Survey going through the court system. If so, who is the group and/or attorney who might be challenging this AND is it in the form of a Class action suit (if a class action suit could be brought against a branch of government) and can we sign on?<br> With all due respect, I for one would greatly appreciate answers to these questions from you.</p>

               <p>Good morning Kevin,</p> 
               <p>While I try to respond or help everyone who posts here, Ive noticed that many times, fellow commenters address certain concerns that are brought up or relate their own experiences for some of the newer readers. Sometimes I miss a few as there are close to 400 comments now.</p> 
               <p>As for continuing down this path <br> My advice is for you to merely fall back on the fortitude that prompted you to ask questions in the first place. The plethora of Supreme Court cases that uphold ones privacy are almost endless and there has not been a single case  to date  involving the Census bringing someone to court for refusal. Furthermore, I believe your fellow readers could assist a bit better than I could when it comes to potential lawsuits or challenges that are currently in the works. Many of the commenters are armed with the latest information. While I try to stay abreast of any major changes or actions, to be quite honest, I have not been heavily involved in Census issues for quite some time now. </p> 
               <p>Many of these comments refer to the American Community Survey, which I did not receive this year or last. When this was first publicized, it was referring to the 2010 Census. Obviously, the privacy laws that apply to the Constitutional Census most certainly apply to the purely administrative American Community survey, and go above and beyond in protecting American citizens from intrusions and violations of their private information (persons, papers, and effects).</p> 
               <p>I cant quite tell you exactly what to expect. With the diverse discussions that have happened here, and the descriptions as to just how harassing some of these workers are, I can only give you general advice. What worked for me will likely not work for you, as I began to find it amusing and almost laughable each time workers knocked on my door. But  I didnt have kids or a spouse to be concerned about, either. Being a former police officer, I also am not as concerned with strangers at my door or putting them in their place if need be. We are all different, but I would suggest that if a worker physically harasses you at your home by knocking, continually leaving material in your door or on your porch, I would file a complaint with your local police or sheriffs department. </p> 
               <p>The very first time that one calls you or comes to your house, tell them in no uncertain terms that you are refusing to participate in this administrative survey, that you opt-out due to privacy concerns, or whatever you feel conveys the message. Get Constitutional with them if you feel the need, however it might be easiest to say as little as possible and end the conversation. Furthermore, clearly advise them that any continued visits will be considered trespassing and that local law enforcement will be called immediately. </p> 
               <p>If you have a lengthy driveway or dirt road, perhaps a gate, I would certainly post a sign declaring that trespassing is unlawful. For those in apartments or have small front yards, its a bit harder to prove that someone was intentionally encroaching onto your property with the intent to harass or inconvenience you. When they have to walk 100 yds to your front door, its a bit easier to show intent. These workers do not have any legal authority to enter your property. They are not meter readers for the utility company. They are not using old logging trails and easements to traverse your property. They are not police officers armed with a search or arrest warrant. They have no lawful right to remain upon your land if instructed to leave.</p> 
               <p>My opinion is to get local law enforcement involved because I dont KNOW, as I said, of any cases being put together in order to stop the harassment and irresponsible behavior by some of these Survey workers. </p> 
               <p>Then again, some people have reported that they received a few phone calls, to which they did not answer, and that was the extent of the harassment. Like all functions of government, you can never count on it to be consistent!</p> 
               <p>Please let us  let ME  know if we can be of any assistance. Keep everyone else updated on this page, as there are many, many more wondering these same things but have yet to comment or write about them. Be confident that you <strong>do</strong> have the law on your side; both Supreme Court case law and the United States Constitution. As I stated earlier, draw on your initial gut reaction and confidence to give you strength, patience, and the proper temperament to endure the lovely honor of being chosen to participate in this wonderfully intrusive survey.</p> 
               <p>Cheers,<br> Kevin Hayden<br> Founder, TruthisTreason.net</p>

             <p>Hey Kevin,<br> Check out the Rutherford Institute. They are on the right side of this issue. For whatever it is worth, we received the ACS in August 2011 and returned it with<br> Haydens cover letter which we signed as Resident. We also did return the<br> full survey with only the number of residents indicated, nothing else. To date, we<br> have received no follow-up communications by mail, phone, or in person. From<br> the sound of the other posts I think we were just lucky. Stick with your guns,<br> figuratively speaking of course. Like most government workers they would<br> probably do something else rather than work..</p>

             <p>Kevin and all</p> 
             <p>This harrassment has motivated me to begin my own blog. Currently, Im focusing on the ACS, but will eventually have other commentary. </p> 
             <p>I am extremely concerned about the Jan. 31 DHS lexicon and how your current letter may be interpreted. You are correct, but lets not get anyone on DHSs radar if we dont need to. (And Im convinced CB &amp; DHS will be discussing ACS resistance, DHS could make the harrassment much worse.) I am drafting some language focused on the statutory and regulatory problems with this set up, in addition to doing additional background research and analysis. </p> 
             <p>My stalker sounded very sad on the last voicemail. Im more than halfway through the cycle (at least, I hope so), and my non-engagement has so far been successful. I hope my story will help others in this situation. </p>

             <p>I appreciate your sincere reply. I continually receive phone calls on almost a daily basis. As I stated previously, I either hang up or ignore the message. The only issue is that my wife is getting frustrated and concerned. I hope that someone can bring this issue to some individual who can do something about it.</p>

             <p>Help, I am being harrassed by the Census Bureau. I have already answered all of their questions about a month ago and now they starting calling me again, My boyfriend asked them why they are doing this since I already had told them everything they wanted to know. They told him that they felt my answers were not totally honest. I am in shock that they would even say something short of calling me a liar. I answered every question truthfully. When they called me again last night they started asking me the same questions over again. I told them I have already answered these questions and they told me they will call me as many times as it takes to get their Census. What the hell does this mean? That my answers did not fit what they wanted to hear? It is like they want me to lie about my answers. These people are crazy! I told them who do they think they are the Gestapo? That is when the guy cut me off and hung up. My boyfriend is pissed they started calling tonight too but the answering machine picked up the call. He wants to call a lawyer to get these people to stop harrassing us. What do we do????</p>

               <p>Well, Im no lawyer, but it certainly wouldnt hurt to contact one if you have a friend in the business or something. Im not sure many lawyers are up for tackling the Census Bureau without a large retainer fee in their pocket.</p> 
               <p>Police reports for harassment are free, though. ((if that sort of law is on the books in your area, that is))</p> 
               <p>Unfortunately, I am starting to believe that lawsuits are the ONLY way to stop this nonsense. If any lawyers stumble across this comment or article, please chime in and give us your opinion on the merits.</p> 
               <p>One thing to understand, in your quest for, Why are they doing this?  </p> 
               <p>The Census, and especially the American Community Survey, creates jobs. If you want to call it a job, that is. But by doing this, and sending them back out 4 or 5 times, calling people who had either answered or refused, keeps hundreds of thousands of people employed. Its politics, as usual.</p> 
               <p>Good luck and let us know what happens, Marissa.</p>

             <p>Hi Kevin &amp; all,<br> This is just a follow up from two weeks ago. Field Representative visits have ceased, though I have now been twice hit up by a Senior Field Representative, and another threatening mailing. Posting your form letter did nothing, and returning the blank packet with the letter enclosed (indicating the number of residents that live here) did nothing. It just keeps moving up the chain of command. From what Ive gathered from here and elsewhere though, I believe this signifies that its getting towards the end of my cycle. I can handle 6 more days if I must. </p> 
             <p>Nevertheless, the main reason for my post today is to share some interesting reading material I found. I presume you all know the old saying, Information is power? Well, what more powerful information is there than an American Community Survey, US Census Bureau, Field Representatives Manual? Gotta love Google and non-copyrighted government materials! Theres all kinds of helpful info about their processes, but whats most pertinent to us is the information on refusal &amp; non-interviews in chapters 7 &amp; 8. Happy reading!

             <p>Well, if the cycle estimates are correct, I should be done with this harrassment as of today. I got two supervisor letters in addition to a couple more attempted visits (the front desk is on to them &amp; doesnt let them past anymore). </p> 
             <p>I can see how CB can escalate for single-family homes for secured condos/apmts its much more difficult to snoop around &amp; actively harrass people. </p> 
             <p>I read a mind-blowing GAO letter to a Congressman from 04 that just blew my mind. In one sentence GAO admitted CB didnt have statutory authority to do what they are doing with the ACS. In the VERY NEXT SENTENCE, they then said that CB had legal authority to do the ACS. W. T. F. So they are on very shaky ground, and the high-level mucktymucks have to know it. In all the background Ive read, including reports from statistians on making the ACS mandatory Ive seen absolutely ZERO discussion about the actual content of the survey and how people might consider it completely offensive. Just stunning.</p>

             <p>Received the survey yesterday, started to fill it in and decided to check the internet and came across this site. Good information. I checked with my congressmans local office this morning and referenced HR 931. Was informed by office staff that this bill had quite a number of sponsors, but was brought up last session, never voted on (this is my assumption) and was not carried over to the next session. I finally caught an early post that it is now HR 3131. I told the staffer that I found the required information intrusive and it was none of the government business other than what I was constitutionally required to give. I asked her if she had seen the document, answer was no, but had heard from others. I plan on copy the aforementioned cover letter and then answering only the number of people living at this address as pushing back in Reno noted in his comments. See you all in the gulag.</p>

             <p>Got the first postcard advising that we would receive survey in early Feb and then a note saying that we needed to get it done (but no survey). Then the survey arrived having been originally misdelivered. Got a second survey a couple of weeks ago. First phone call last night. Just read the field workers manual, and found it interesting that they talk about finalizing and transmitting a case as a refusal, vs. turning it over for prosecution, etc. Nervous about dealing with the harrassment, but dont want to answer the questions. I did email Neal Boortz with the field guide link; figured he would find it interesting. Will update with how our situation proceeds. We have a 12 year old son, so that is my only concern. Thanks for being here.</p>

             <p>What about Article 16 of the law? How does that affect your decision to not fill out the census? Or how about the statistics act of 1999? I ask because a friend told me thats how their forcing people to fill this out.</p> 
             <p>Ive also heard that they have formally pressed charges on a few families. Have any of you heard of this?</p>

             <p>It came to my attention that thus survey is entitled American Census Survey, and not US Census Survey. My suspicions are confirmed after going to the website: <a href="http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-888-419-7586" rel="nofollow">http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-888-419-7586</a>. There a former field supervisor with the US Census wrote the following:<br> after reading some of the other posts on this page i feel the need to repost my reply at the top of this page for all to see:</p> 
             <p>just recieved the same call tonight and have not called back, but i can tell you as a former census field supervisor that no census will ask for any financial information and they will not push if you refuse anythingyou are allowed to refuse information even on the original census form and there are provisions in place on how to handle those forms without any more grief to you, so if they ask for any info having to do with your finances or your home other than verifying your address then it is a scam and needs to be reported</p> 
             <p>I would not fill out the form, and report it to the Attorney Generals Office.</p>

             <p>I just spent 15 minutes on my front porch doing the same thing I did with these clowns by not sending in the ACS, refused to give them a bunch of info that is NOT constitutionally required. She kept telling me it is the law title 13 you have to your identification is closely protected its used for good, bla bla bla. Guess what she got? A bunch of refusal to answer and my name, sex, age, date of birth, race, ethnicity, telephone number, relationship, housing tenure, and the same for residents of my home. Somehow the same answers I gave on the short form + my refusals on the other long form questions = ACS completed to them. Then, she has the audacity to say Im closed minded. Smug non-thinking self-righteous self-serving bureaucrats. They can all kiss my ass. I kept explaining the constitution and she somehow thought that title 13 trumps the constitution. Although it was a fun distraction speaking with someone like this, next time, they get a simple letterand maybe a stick drawn finger ..|.., Hey ACSsuck it!</p>

             <p>Well, almost made it without them finding anything other than my name. (Which they still have WRONG, btw HA!) Unfortunately, my neighbors elderly mother thought she was talking to a postman or something and before I could stop her told my CB stalker how many people lived in my place, that we look white and an approximate age range for me (also wrong). After I screamed at him to stop, he tried to act like nothing was wrong, and then she got the idea and he left. She was upset about it (I was a lot more upset, but I get it shes visiting from another country and thinks were all ok here in the States). Finally showed the ACS to her daughter who was APPALLED. (I thought this was a free country! says the naturalized citizen. Me too. says the born citizen.) </p> 
             <p>That was day 30 of the personal harrassment cycle.</p> 
             <p>Since then, no phone calls, but a different CB stalker has shown up three times (that Im aware of). Tried to question a different neighbor, who shut the door in his face. </p> 
             <p>So I hope theyre done. All they got was NOTHING it isnt accurate, and so its useless. Next time, Im gonna put a sign on my door announcing that These premises are protected by GLOCK </p> 
             <p>I feel for people who have snoopy neighbors willing to give them up to ANYONE. I feel for people who dont have the ability to either screen visitors or prevent people from coming on their property.</p> 
             <p>This need to END.</p>

             <p>Funny just as I was typing this comment I got another call from the Census folks.. That makes it about 10 so far and one door bell ring at 8:00am. I just found this web site, used the template letter above, filled out only the number of people in the household and mailed the letter and ACS form (with all but the one entry blank) in. I hope that makes the calls and visits go away.</p> 
             <p>Thanks for this site and the letter, really appreciate knowing I am not alone in thinking the ACS is unconstitutional.</p>

             <p>Anymore info on the USDA 2012 National Agricultural Classification Survey? I received my second one about a week ago but my wifes name is first this time, then mine. It has a due date of Feb. 3rd. In bold letters Response is required by law. There is a face letter describing all the reasons why it is important to complete the survey and a reminder in the second paragraph and in bold letters required by federal law. It also says my response will be kept confidential. Says I have within 10 days to complete and return. Hasnt happened yet! Now what? Does this letter in your report hold true for the USDA survey? I am retired law enforcement and by state law all my personal info including addresses, phone numbers, etc. are confidential for obvious reasons. This includes my wife and children! So where do I go next?</p>

             <p>Received two surveys and ignored them. Now the harassment has started. Census worker has been to the house at least five times that we know of since March 1. Sometimes sits in the car out front, waiting for someone to arrive or leave. So far, have avoided him. He has also contacted all of the immediate neighbors and the president of the homeowners association trying to track us down. I called our Congressmans office and they said we need to comply and there is nothing he could do to help us. This is crazy. When will the stalking stop?</p>

             <p>The 5th Amendment is the answer. Get the Census Taker to admit that incorrectly completing the questions could be a crime. Use your right to take the 5th and REMAIN SILENT. You can chat with your local police, in advance, to see if they understand private property rights and will enforce trespassing laws. You also have the right to file a private criminal complaint against the Census Taker for trespassing and harassment. TELL the Census Taker that you are video and audio recording them. Video the Census Takers car and license plate for identification. Do NOT video a cop as this will make him angry. On EACH call, TELL the Census Taker that you are recording the telephone call. REPEATEDLY assert your 5th Amendment right and then SHUT UP and REMAIN SILENT. Call the police only if you have already confirmed, in advance, that they will enforce your right to have a trespasser get off of your property. Always be polite but firm and then be SILENT. </p> 
             <p>I asked the arrogant Census Taker if people refused to provide all that personal information. He said that it was a crime to refuse. I asked if it was a crime to answer with incorrect, erroneous or incomplete information, and he declared that it certainly was a crime. So I informed him that I was claiming my 5th Amendment right and remaining silent. </p> 
             <p>He was stunned and then said the law requires me to answer, the law outweighs the 5th Amendment, and that I have no 5th Amendment right. I replied that he had stated it was a crime to answer incorrectly and so even if I made an innocent error I could be committing a crime and thus I would remain silent. He demanded that I answer and I demanded that he leave.</p> 
             <p>Since then I had to videotape his return visits and call the police. The discussion with the police was interesting. Ultimately the police agreed that even the police cant compel information from someone who has taken the 5th and so neither could the Census Taker. The Census Taker made a big mistake by arguing with and being rude to the cop. The cop didnt like the belligerent attitude and told the Census Taker to get off of my property or be arrested for trespassing. The Census taker had to retreat.</p>

             <p>An attorney might take a case against the Census creep for exceeding their authority, trespassing, window peeking, making threats and upsetting the kids. Only use a contingency fee and never pay an attorney up-front or you will kiss your money goodbye.</p> 
             <p>Your Congressman is worthless. Congress is the source of these problems. If you read about Congress you will see that they have no concern for you or your family, they disregard the Constitution, are for sale to the next lobbyist, are exempt from the laws they pass for the rest of us, and waste lots of taxpayer money. You mean nothing to your Congressman. They only want you to submit as that is how they get their power. Stop voting the same people back into office again and again! </p> 
             <p>The letter describing all the reasons why it is important to complete the survey, is why it is important and helpful to the government. So they can use the information against you. It is never helpful to you!</p> 
             <p>I would not send them any letter or reply at all. Anything you say can and will be used against you. I like Williams idea to just use your right to the 5th amendment and be silent. Most people just cant shut up. Here is why you want to take the 5th: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wXkI4t7nuc</a> YouTube and search 5th amendment.</p>

             <p>As Marissa says (Feb 22, 2012 ),  Even if you do tell them everything, it will only be used against you. Your answers give them a reason to continue to call and hound you because they dont feel you were totally honest! So dont tell them anything! If you make an honest mistake on an answer you might be accused of causing a crime. Best to say nothing in such circumstances.</p> 
             <p>As VVV says (Mar 02, 2012) the US Census Bureau did in fact provide the names and addresses of Japanese Americans so they could be put in prison camps during World War 2. Similar agencies in Germany helped Hitler exterminate his opponents. The Census is the government, so certainly they are going to share your private information. How are you going to stop them once they have the information? If you are dumb enough to give it to them then you already lost. When does the government ever obey the law? When does the government give you any information? All the government information is secret and you arent allowed to know.</p> 
             <p>As ERIN says (Mar 12, 2012) you should video record them, but some state laws require informing them that you are audio recording too. So to be safe, inform them that you are video and audio recording their visit. Inform them if you record their phone calls.</p> 
             <p>William (Mar 13, 2012) is right. There is no sense in trying to talk to these Census bullies. Take the 5th and then be silent. You forfeit your 5th amendment right if you keep talking! So be quiet, shut-up and simply repeat that you have taken the 5th and the right to be silent. Dont blab on, as what you say can and will be used against you. There is no point in arguing with these scum as you are not going to change their mind. So tell them that you have taken the 5th and that the conversation is now over, then hang-up the phone or close the door.</p> 
             <p>There is a nice group or community of people here, which could fight other issues too. With all the websites and blogs it seems that no one has yet organized the people into a coherent force to oppose injustice. We all must work together. I hope to see a group develop somewhere soon.</p>

                 <p>I have to agree with the rest of you who advocate silence. Again, AS STATED IN THEIR OWN HANDBOOK in sections 7 &amp; 8: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-UcecQAFOe0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=-UcecQAFOe0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a>, one of the options they have for people who refuse to answer is to mark the address as a Silent Refusal. There is nothing , anywhere, indicating prosecution for non-compliance besides in the propaganda that they peddle to you. If refusing to participate was such an illegal activity, they would have a process outlined in their own training manual on how to handle us deviants. As for me, its been three and a half weeks since my last contact from one of these ACS goons. I have heard nothing more. Moreover, why havent I been prosecuted for refusing to answer these questions? Its because the whole thing is a farcea bold faced liea ploy to pump the public for information. Theyll try their damnedest to get you to crack, but ignoring them works.</p>

               <p>Well, they didnt come to my door today , but.. At 7:10pm recd a call and voicemail. ? who gave them my prepaid phone number? She was trying to get me to confirm everything  surveys in mail, letters reg. mail, Fed-X letters, Mr. Beltower visits, his supervisor visits. I told her I had given a written statement (THANKS HAYDEN!!) to Mr. B and asked if she had that noted. No.</p> 
               <p>It was given to him, 2 people live in this house, and I continue to take the 5th fto every single question on the survey. She tried to talk me into answering many, saying the ones I thought too personal, I could refuse to answer.

               <p>2 people live in this house. On every question I take the 5th. Cease and desist (sounds impressive? LoL!), including home visits and calls to this number, or it will be harrassment and trespassing. I am now ending this conversation I hope I am done with these dipsh!ts!</p>

                 <p>ho-hum. The supervisor guy from a couple of days ago appeared today! Told him (her supervisor), as Ms Coker was told last night, I take the 5th on all of the questions. He tried to talk me in to answering at least some questions so he wouldnt have to show I refused. Huh? as I chuckled in disbelief. Well, so exactly how many questions would it take for it to show me as in compliance?  Good grief. Restated taking the 5th Amendment to answer each and every question other than 2 people reside in this house. He threw the $5,000 fine that will result from not answering his questions. I told him to stop coming to my house and stop calling  trespassing and harrassing. He used his finger to pound on his binder and said that I could call the police and he will just show them my orders and they would allow me to walk across my property to pound on my door. WTH?

I told them I filled out the form in 2010 and stop calling me. They said theyre just going to keep calling back because it is a mandatory survey. Does anyone know what gives?

             <p>Being harassed by Census Bureau because I didnt answer personal questions on ACS. First the threatening mailing, then the reminder. Then I filled out the basic stuff, headcount, ages, etc. Asked year of house and electric bill costs and I became offended they would ask such things. Skimmed through to see it only got worse and more personal. Sent it in with only basic info. Received a call. Asked that lady where in the Constitution it stated I had to tell her what year my house was built. She stammered and asked if I was a refusal. I said yes. Got another call, voicemail, asking me to return their call regarding case # whatever it was. Called again wanting answers, she again threatened it is required by law, I said no its not she said yes it is I said no its not she said Im not going to argue with you, and I hung up on her. If they come to my door, Im calling the cops. This is harassment. It isnt even census year. Please, vote for presidents and senators and representatives who stand for SMALL GOVERNMENT or this will only get worse.</p>

             <p>Was also threatened by a rep from the Census Bureau about 2-3 months ago. Wish I had found this site sooner, but so glad to have this bookmarked now! Gotta love dummies that flash a badge and think they can scare you into submission.</p>

             <p>I know my rights. Refused to fill out the form went straight in the trash. Next they came a calling and I told them to get lost. Next came another census because Im a business owner wanting to know all about income/employees etc etc. Again the cycle started up. Once a month they come a calling. First I told the person to simply F..K Off. Theres no way in hell the government is going fillet my life and then come back down the road and tax /screw me some more.<br> Now they send a very nice lady. She is resigned to the fact that she isnt going to get anything so we talk about the weather, have a laugh and thats that.<br> They will take an 8 month break and start up again for 4 more visits in 2013. Bring it on. Send your worst. Theres a shit storm waiting just inside. Oh just a note about myself. I am Welsh born and bred. I became a legal American citizen 10 years ago. (Sworn in at Mount Rushmore no less). Anyway we Brits really hate the government in all its many monstrous forms. No matter where I live I will always fight these blood sucking bastards on just about every level.</p>

             <p>We had at least ten visits from two different census people in a three week period. Thank goodness we were out of town the last week. They kept bugging the neighbors too and left notes on top of notes on the door. The last note said today is the final day to complete your survey. That was a week ago, havent heard anything since. Hoping they dont come back. The harassment is ridiculous.</p>

             <p>Hi Hayden,<br> I just received the ACS and want to inform everyone that they need to call or contact the Rutherford Law Institute asap. They have started action and posted the following (see below) a few days ago.</p> 
             <p>If there is any hope of legal action against the ACS the Institute needs everyone to let them know. This is a serious issue in which bullying and harassment has now become standard practice. I am your average English teacher and cant believe the terrible questions they ask me. Please everyone call and sign up with them today! </p>

             <p>On The Front Lines<br> Rutherford Institute Issues Final Warning to Census Bureau Over Forcing Americans to Complete Highly Invasive Surveys Unrelated to Census</p> 
             <p>March 22, 2012</p> 
             <p>WASHINGTON, DC  John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute, has issued a stern warning to the Census Bureau that Institute attorneys are prepared to challenge the American Community Survey (ACS) as an unconstitutional overreach by the agency on behalf of a large number of clients who object to being forced under penalty of law to complete the highly intrusive and expansive questionnaire. Whiteheads warning comes in response to a letter by Census Bureau Director Robert Groves, in which the agency head justified the ACS as providing information that can be useful to private industry, and private entitiesa justification, noted Whitehead, that will not pacify the countless individuals who have voiced their objections to the intrusive questionnaire, as well as the harassing tactics of Census Bureau workers.</p> 
             <p>There is no way that those who founded this country would have authorized the federal government to incessantly or perpetually demand, under penalty of law, such detailed information from the American people, said Whitehead. Indeed, the American Community Survey contains some of the most detailed and intrusive questions ever put forth in a census questionnaire, concerning matters that the government simply has no business knowing, including a persons job, income, physical and emotional health, family status, place of residence and intimate personal and private habits.</p> 
             <p>Unlike the traditional census, which collects data every ten years, the American Community Survey (ACS) is sent to about 3 million homes per year at a reported cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, while the traditional census is limited to ascertaining the number of persons living in each dwelling, their ages and ethnicities, the ownership of the dwelling and telephone numbers, the ACS is overly expansive, asking questions relating to respondents bathing habits, home utility costs, fertility, marital history, work commute, mortgage, and health insurance, among others.</p>

             <p>I received the ACS survey initially in Dec. 2010 and then postcards reminding me about it, a second copy, and eventually a FedEx. There was no way I was going to answer the personal questions and after researching the outrageous ACS on the internet, I chose not to respond at all. After the first call from the ACS sometime in Feb. 2011 (no one was home), I contacted my family &amp; friends and told them that I would no longer pick up the phone, that all calls would go to voicemail. Then I received several more phone calls from the ACS and I did nothing. Then I had a personal visit by an agent who left yet another copy and a hand writen note asking me to contact her (I was at work). I responded to her note with a note that asked her to tell me what article in the US Constitution required me to fill out such personal information and left it at my front door. I then left for a 3 week vacation in May 2011. When I returned, the packet with both notes was still inside my screen door and I was getting ACS calls. I was tired of the waste of $ and so I called her and left a message stating that I participated in the 2010 Census and would not participate in the ACS without being shown specifically where in our Constitution it is required. After my call, I have not been contacted in the past 10 months. I just refused to respond period!! Maybe the agent with my case was not as persistent as others.<br> I also wrote my Representatives and Senators and just got their automatic responses. Good luck to us all!!</p>

             <p>Received postcards around Xmas telling me the survey was coming. Assumed it was a scam. Could NOT believe it was for real. Received the first survey and just ignored it.<br> The second one arrived and out of guilt, I started to fill it outbut just could NOT with all the private info they wanted. (My birthday??? Really? how is that relevant??? and if its anonymous why are they asking for my name?) Found this site and others and it really gave me the confidence to feel that I could fight it.<br> The phone calls started and I followed the advice of Lazarus I read on another blogbe firm, but polite, and dont let them think for a second that you will cave.<br> I told Rachel that there was NO way I would fill it outthat I had been a victim of identity theft and would NOT give out any information and just to save everyone from wasting any more time, to put me down as a refusal. I thought that would be itbut no. The second one who called a week later was snippy and I said all the same things to her. She said I could just skip the questions I didnt likeI told her I didnt like any of them. She said I will mark you down as a refusal. I said, greatthen are we all done here? She said, Nonow I will refer it to the Justice Department !!! I said are you threatening me? She said no, thats just our protocolhave a nice day and hung up really quickly. Two weeks later I received a letter that said they understood that I had some fears about my information staying confidential, but that it is very secureblah blah blah and please reconsider and send it in. Its been 4-6 weeks nowno visits..no more callsfor SURE it has been more than their 90 day cycleso I think that I made it. I cannot imagine what the rest of you are going thru with all these home visits. Lots of talk these days of stand your ground, and now that we can see what their manual advises, anything that goes beyond that, I believe we can call them on it.chapter and verse.</p>

             <p>What is this 90 day cycle you people speak of? I received my packet before Christmas, got the phone calls for about a month and a half  up until about 1  2 weeks ago, and received my first visit today, from a Maria Trujillo. She seemed shocked when I treated her like a salesperson and told her I wasnt interested just before shutting the door in her face while she was attempting to tell me its not about whether you are interested or not. I guess the real fun is just starting. Thank you for this website Kevin, Im sure I would be a little freaked out right now (or worse  giving in?) if not for reading everyones stories.</p>

             <p>Well i just got my visit tonight. A Mrs. Kubovec knocked on my door tonight. I told her i had no interest in doing this Census and i had already done my duty and filled out the first real Census. She smiled and told me that we needed to do this one for schools, money, and roads. I stopped her there and stated i had no interest nor the time to do this census. I was told she would be back in a week to do it if i dont contact her this week. She said something about a fine if i did not do the census. I asked her what the fine was she said The fine was $250,000 dollars and 5 years in prison. I was shocked and asked her to repeat it in case i heard it wrong. Nope i heard her right the first time. What the hell? 250 thousand and 5 years in prison?</p>

THEN SOMEWAY they found old oldest married bank manager sons cell and called him to ask where we were and why we have not returned their calls. He had no idea what they were talking about and hung up on them. They tried to call back but he will not answer his cell. He is 39 years old, married for ten years, two children and not lived in our home for 14 years. WOW the power or gull of this group!</p>

             <p>OMG  our government has run amuck!!!!<br> On March 25th, our local newspaper had a headline Census datas flow could slow  second headlline Bill to guard privacy troubles policymakers. The article mentions HR 931 (by US Rep Ted Poe  R-Texas) currently referred to the House of Rep. Subcommittee on the Constitution (see <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.931" rel="nofollow">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.931</a>?  it would END MANDATORY PARTICIPATION in the American Community Survey. Basically the article says that our local policymakers in Vancouver Washington think this bill would make the data unreliable and they use that data to plan for the future, equitably distribute services and measure progress on a variety of benchmarks. Making the ACS unreliable would cause local Governments to do a sample survey themselves and that would be very expensive according to this article. Claims are that the current response rate is 97%  98% and if they make it optional the response rate would decrease by at least 20%. In order to keep participation rates the same, Congress would have to invest $66.5 million per year to make home visits to unresponsive survey residents in order to persuade them to respond according to Census Bureau director, Robert Graves. The American Community Survey is our only tool for tracking a wide range of demographic statistics in Clark County on a consistent basis.according to Scott Bailey, regional ecomonist for the state Employment Security Department.<br> Sorry this is so dry, but we need to CONTACT OUR REPRESENTATIVES and tell them we support HR 931!!! This article was nothing more than trying to justify an obtrusive government survey. I would like to know specifically what questions they need to ask that are not already in the 10 year census  it is just BS!! And then the Census director mentioning the cost to persude them  so thats what they call harrassment!<br> Hayden  is there any way you could draft a letter we could send to our Reps about the need for HR 931 and perhaps even send out a petition?</p>

             <p>i find it ironic that every institution now is required to give you a privacy notification that your information will be protected and kept confidential yet the ACS continues to Invade our privacy in such an invasive way. Its a shame.<br> are these the jobs that are said to be created by the administration? what a lie.</p>

             <p>The following in itself can keep anyone off your property by presenting them with the signed trespass notice. Basically from what I am reading below that all you have to do is tell the person there trespassing and present them with the below.</p> 
             <p>This has to do with the Bill Of Rights Of The United States Constitution Amendment#4 </p>

             <p>Weve received a handful of letters along with 2 copies of the forms and 3 personal visits. I now have personal information on my Census stalker such as home address, number of children and the fact that it was 1 year ago on 4/12/2012 that she buried her husband.

             <p>Thanks for all of the helpful information. When we received the ACS, we thought it was a scam and could not believe our government would 1) ask for such personal information; and 2) waste so much time and money on this survey. Your website was most helpful in understanding what the ACS is and what to do. We are returning our survey to them with Refusal written on it along with a copy of your cover letter. I sure hope that ends it for us.</p>

             <p>Going on month 4 here. I was expecting someone yest. and the knock was timid (instead of the aggressive Ring and try to break the door down MO theyve used) so I opened it. Her name is Lillie. I told her it was nice to meet her but that I would be shutting the door now. She then started giggeling the door handle and stuffing things threw the door again. I waited until she was about done. Opened it and handed it back to her. She did it a total of 3 times. The last time she stuffed a hand written note stating my fine was now up to $5000. She went to my neighbors and they laughed at her (all military). She was so rattled she then backed over my trash cans on the curb. My neighbors came over and informed me of what she had just done and checked out the cans for me. They were very upset with her and wanted to call the police. She sat there for 30 minutes blocking my driveway and watching us. I walked out with her last note and placed it in the trash can that she was sitting by. </p> 
             <p>I have been hiding for the last 4 months. Im done. I am a US citizen and will no longer stay cooped up in my own home. We as a community made ourselves known and I feel very grateful for that fact. The Constitution is alive on THIS block. A wonderful lesson through all of this I think.</p>

             <p>I am needing help with this also. I do not know what they are calling it but last fall a woman shows up at my house and leaves form stating she is from census bureau. I was not home. Then I get a phone call telling me she is returning. That she does. I see census bureau tag hanging from her neck and it looks legit. She asked basic questions about how long i have lived there, blah, blah, blah. I am not liking this at all. I asked her what this was about and she said all this info would end up on President Obamas desk concerning unemployment in the usa. It still does not hit right with me. I am told I will get a call each month by worker asking questions and this will last almost one year. I got first call and answered questions. Next month worker calls and even asks about interest I get from iras and other info about my private life I do not like and I told him so. It was then I decided after listening to him and his telling me i had to answer the questions that I decided I would not go through this again. They called again two days ago. I said I did not like this and that info was still the same and would not be changing. She became rude and said are you not going to answer the questions and I said absolutely not after the previous invasion of my personal life by the census bureau. The woman called again yesterday and I am already sick and can barely talk and she begins asking questions again. I said nothing has changed and I will not answer any more of their questions. Are you refusing I was asked and I said I will not go through this invasion of my privacy again. I know it was census bureau because it was on caller id. How much of this do we have to take. I resent our government doing this and how is it helping our president to learn about unemployment situations in this nation??? They can arrest me if they want but they will get no other info from me.</p>

             <p>3rd visit from census worker Maria Trujillo today. She left many forms outside the door, including one that read shall be fined not more than $1,000 (last weeks note stated up to $250,000). She also left a hand written note  just so you know I have to close out this case next week. You may be fined. I sure am going to miss her. Im thinking of answering the door next week and telling her I will fill it out and have it ready for her next week just to drag this out a little longer.</p>

             <p>I partially completed the ACS form and sent it in. After a month or so another form arrived. Threw that one out. Then the calls started. About 40 calls total. Shortly after that the personal visits started. But what happened on the last visit really pissed me off. Were having dinner at about 7:30 pm on a Saturday night. The door bell rings and then a loud knock at the door. We didnt answer because we were eating dinner. Then I see a woman standing in my BACK yard staring into our very private REAR patio. She was had walked approximately 100 feet from the public sidewalk and between two houses into my BACK yard!!! I confronted her, asked her who she was and why she was trespassing on my property. She only told me she was from the US Census Bureau and gave me no other info.While I was physically escorting her off my property I told her she had made a conscious decision to trespass on my property, had violated my 4 th Amendment rights and invaded my privacy. I then told her to get the %&amp;*^ off my property and dont even think of returning. In her haste to leave she dropped a business card with her name on it. I am writing a letter of complaint about her to the US Census via certified mail but am also seriously considering hiring an attorney to go after them for this one. Ringing my doorbell is one thing but peeping in on us in our very private BACK yard is a flagrant violation of the 4th amendment.</p>

             <p>We have just had our third phone call as of yesterday. The 2nd phone call I took and was told twice that I am breaking the law, my reply was so be it My Husband and I are both in our 60s and find all this very stressful, but we will continue to NOT answer any of the questions. It would be interesting to know where everyone is from and where these forms are being sent, we are in East Tennessee</p>

               <p>I just received my first form in the mail. I feel just as angry about as everyone above, and my gut is telling me this is all wrong. Im angered that my refusal to fill out such a form may cause me and my spouse hours or days of frustration and stress. I noticed that you first posted in march. I really do not want to have anything to do with this survey. Do you feel like it was worth opting out with all the harassment youve experienced from these people? Im afraid I may not be able to exhibit the type of patience with these people as some of the above had. Should I just send it back with all lies??</p>

             <p>Hyden,</p> 
             <p>I received the form recently. Today, I was about to fill the form, but as soon as I saw the question regarding toilet, I sense something wrong. Even as a immigrant from a country with less human rights, I have never seen any government survey that is so personal and intrusive. So I googled it and found your site. I think your analysis and response is inspirational and empowering I wonder if you or anyone who is visiting this site is willing to start a petition in <a href="http://www.change.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.change.org</a>. Its a petition site which has lot of success stories. I am not confident on starting such petition but I will certainly be the first the sign and spread the words.</p>

               <p>I have read the BLOG here with great interest, as I have just received the ACS and am incensed by its invasive character. I checked out the sections of the US Code referenced by Kevin, and I found his interpretation, particularly of the Title 18 Sections to be very illuminating. However, his conclusion that the $5,000 fine is bogus may not be correct. If you check out the Title 18 Chapter 227 Subchapter A  General Provisions Section 3551 which preceeds 3559 and 3571 amongst others, it states: Except as otherwise specifically provided, a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense described in ANY Federal statute.shall be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, etc. To me, that means that Title 18 does apply to Title 13. Even more concerning, when you look at Section 3571, it not only says that an infraction (defined as an offense garnering a jail sentence of 5 days or less or none) is subject to a $5,000 fine, it also goes on to say If a law setting forth an offense specified no fine or a fine that is lower than the fine otherwise applicable under this section and such law, by specific, reference, exempts the offense from the applicability of the fine otherwise applicable under this section, the defendant may not be fined more than the maount specified in the law setting forth the offense. It took me awhile to figure out the flow of that sentence. It means that because Title 13 does not specifically mention an exemption from Title 18, then Title 18 overrides! So, what seems to remain is the fact that the Department of Justice probably couldnt be bothered  I hope. Im going to take that risk, because weve got to stand for our right to privacy. So much of it has already been eroded just by the very nature of modern daily life. Not only that, but the Constitution trumps all Statutory law as far as I can ascertain.</p>

                 <p>Forgot to mention that all their envelopes and business cards they leave wedged on your door between the door and the frame are at eye level and none of the envelopes are ever sealed. They leave it open. I think I will place a small trash can with all the business cards and envelopes they have left in front of my door. I will place a sign saying please leave all Census related material below for recycling, Thank You. I will also leave my own check in form with an application for the Census workers, name, birth dates, address, phone numbers, salary, etc, with a sign in form and time and date they came to my place. I hope they send me the Fedex envelope people are talking about, I will never pick it up. Last, I think I will also put a sign on my door saying CENSUS BUREAU PLEASE FINE ME $5000 AND LET ME BE THE POSTER CHILD AS THE FIRST PERSON EVER FINED FOR REFUSING THE CENSUS. I WILL CONTACT THE ACLU (the enemey of my enemy is my friend) AND SET UP A DONATION FUND FOR PEOPLE TO HELP ME PAY THE FINE. THANK YOU.</p>

             <p>This is amazing!! Just received my survey form with a cover letter from Robert Groves the Director. It states: The U. S. Census Bureau chose your address, not you personally, as part of a randomly selected sample. So why in hell, might one ask, does the very first question ask my name? If the purpose of the survey is to glean information about the residents of a certain community. What difference does it make who that resident is? I am tempted to return the Form with all the correct info except enter Resident in answer to the first question. After all, that is to whom the Survey was addressed. God help us defend ourselves against this intrusive, overreaching Government.</p>

Mike its OK to be gutless and a sycophant, inmate of the collectivist state. but it does expose you as such to put your ignorance or cowardice in writing. Isnt it wonderful, this First Amendment Right. or will you capitulate to the negation of that right and all other rights and Constitutionally mandated limits on the Central government. It brings to mind Stockholm Syndrome and those who ingratiate themselves to their captors. Of course Mike, you can just fill out the form, just hand over your guns, just get in the bus to the Japanese internment camps But some of us respect the genius of our nations philosophy and supreme law. Apparently you do not. WeenieLOL!</p>

                   <p>This is so not difficult.. Listen carefully.. Dont listen to this moron that stated,just fill it out! No that that is out of the way.. You dont have to answer any of it and this is why</p> 
                   <p>The fine that they are threatening to impose for not answering all the questions is exactly that. If you answer your name and how many people live at your house, you are still breakin the law. Therefore Ask the agent if there is a fine for not answering all the questions, is they give you any answer other than yes, they are lying to you. Tell them you read the law and there is a fine and that you reserve the right not to incriminate yourself in future proceedings, therefore you will say nothing, and politely close the door! They cannot argue with you.. But they will try. </p> 
                   <p>The federal government cannot keep your information safe! They cannot keep their own information safe. Just ask private Bradley Manning. Your information is worth more to them than it they believe it is to you. Because once they have it. It can be sold to Walmart corp, meanwhile Walmart corp, doesnt have to spend any time or resources doing their own market research. </p> 
                   <p>Just because these people in government are breaking the law doesnt mean you are required to give up your private information.. The government has the tools to legally get your information.. But if youll notice they are not using it! Subpoenas can be used to get the information.. But you withholding your information is not grounds to issue one! Even if it was.. Just look at CONGRESS vs. ERIC HOLDER.. They subpoenaed documents he had. And Eric refused to give them still. And nothing happened to him! And that was congress that issued it! Not some local flunky census worker, that has no power of indictment! </p> 
                   <p>Do what you want! But ive already explained to my congressman as to why Im not answering any of the questions. In 2010.. Every doorstep in America got GPS located. With this information they are asking for they have the potential to cross refference gun ownership, racial profiling, and just about anything else. In 1943 they used the census information to create internment camps to hold American-Japanese citizens. Information collected legally by they census, but hyjacked by the secret service They temporarily changed the law kinda like they have done with the patriot act. </p> 
                   <p>Protect your rights people! If your privacy isnt worth to you 100 dollars that they have no ability to prosecute you on.. Then what is your privacy worth?!</p> 
                   <p>They cannot protect your information.. But you can, and you should. If you think giving your information is good for society.. Then you are agreeing with these people..</p> 
                   <p>We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society.<br>  Hillary Clinton<br> Sounds just like:</p> 
                   <p>The unity of a nations spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual; and that the higher interests involved in the life of the whole must here set the limits and lay down the duties of the interests of the individual.<br>  Adolf Hitler</p> 
                   <p>Welcome to the new America! Where govt breaks the law, threatens you over laws they have no ability to enforce, but by threatening you and you giving the Info freely.. Means the govt isnt breaking the law! This is why they do this! If you give it up freely then they have done nothing wrong!</p> 
                   <p>If you dont believe me.. I refused to fill it out as well as 10s of thousands of others. And nobody every has been charged or fined over this! Ever! The last thing they want is for someone to upset their bullying and information gathering because of lawsuits and media! There is a reason you never heard of this before it showed up on your doorstep! </p> 
                   <p>Dont give them your personal information.. It violates the 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10th amendments as well as hippa laws. If you wanna give it to them.. Go ahead! Nobody else is doing it happily! And many just outright refuse! Your not alone! 26% that get it, dont return it! Thats 50000 people a month that refuse to answer it! So. Good luck on your decision! Im not answering it!</p>

                   <p>I found after someone slammed my vehicle, causing me permanent disabilities, the lawyers defending the guilty driver found every bit of information on me, such as this, twisted it to incredible lies. It was used against me. There are now lies in my medical records, to the point it took me years to find a doctor that was intelligent and honest enough to get past what was written. All this to save the insurance from paying the medical bills incurred from the accident. They succeeded. This form is claiming to help the community. When I was hurt, the Community did nothing to help me. I was the mother of a Severe Asthmatic Son. With my losss, income, health, my son died. Should I mention when my son was 10 he was abducted and raped by a repeat offender. Yes, Our Community let him out of jail twice. He is in jail now for 70 years, but my sons health was altered through the trauma, and has now passed on. Until you have experienced the trauma caused by the community, you would not have a clue. You call this silly out of ignorance.</p>

               <p>Thanks so much for the research and letter. I did add the following: There are 4 occupants at this address. This is the only information we will provide. And I changed the signature to Adult Occupant Got the green postcard yesterday and my husband who is learning Russian thought of putting a go-jump-in-the-lake reply in Russian but that would just mean some russian speaking fellow will show up so theres not much point in that.</p>

             <p>The census person showed up at my door on Friday May 4, 2012 and my daughter who is almost 9 answered it.I told him that I was refusing to answer the survey and the a$$hole had the audacity to say in front of my kids I could be arrested! Now my kids are afraid mommy is going to jail. My husband came home and told him to leave immediately. I got me a lawyer on retainer this morning.</p>

             <p>Looks like anyone who didnt give them what they wanted the first time around, magically got picked for the second survey, The American Community Survey. Did you know they told me that this is going to be a yearly survey? Im sorry, but with obama signing executive order 13575, do they really think Im going to answer any of their surveys? Didnt work out so well for the guy who came to our house looking for it! And when he left with nothing, we got a certified letter from them threatening us with a fine! All I can say is BRING IT ON!! They want a fight, by gosh, Im ready! Im glad theres a website that will help anyone and everyone who wants to put a stop to BIG government intruding in your life!</p>

               <p>I agree with you re who is selected to complete the ACS. On the Census form originally received I answered only those question which are legally required and under race/ethnicity I checked Other and inserted: American. If somehow it could be proven the government sent these elongated forms in retaliation to those inadequately responding on the short form it would serve as grounds for a class action suit.</p>

                 <p>Dear Mike:</p> 
                 <p>Hitler needed a good survey like this one to do what he did to the poor Jewish people.</p> 
                 <p>The U. S. SS needed a good survey to identify where all the Japanese-Americans were in WWII.</p> 
                 <p>I would think you would be appalled at such a thing as this. But then again the Japs and the Jews filled out their surveys like good law abiding citizens didn,t they? How much did their government love them???? ?</p> 
                 <p>The more information the Gov. has about you the more vulnerable you are. You think the government loves you? Open your eyes and look around you!! Theyre just trying to find out who they can sodimize and how many ways they can do it.</p>

                   <p>Key indicators of Trolls or AKA Troll sighting.</p> 
                   <p>Biggest indicator is grade school grammar and common misspellings of 3rd person pronouns and conjunctions.<br> Additional indicators include play ground type name calling and statements like oh yeah?. While this is typically indicative of someone needing a nap or their parents basement is to small to support a much more than the trundle bed said troll had in grade school but sometimes name calling can be justified with evidence.<br> lastly and usually a big indicators include computer mediated language or or internet slang. usually LOL or OMG and URaH8r as examples. When preceded by the juvenile name calling it is with certainty that said poster is a troll.<br> Although we all care for the planet and all of the beings on it, Trolls have no bag nor season limit. They procreate via response or feeding. Best to ignore and when given the opportunity. Kill it with facts.</p>

One question I have  if on the DO NOT CALL LIST  why cant they be fined too if they call? If I get called, I will say no one by that name lives here. Or that this is not the address of this phone #. Thanks for the letter, I have it all printed out if someone comes to my door  and the Public Servant Questionnaire for the surveyor if they show up.

             <p>We received the long form of the census in 2010 at our old address. I ignored several phone calls from the census bureau trying to obtain the information. Finally my husband spoke with a census worker over the phone who spoke poor English and basically told her very politely that the info she was requesting was not the govts business. A census worker showed up at my new home and I told her I had answered all I was required to answer at my old address. That was then end of that episode.<br> So we then get the ACS about 6 wks ago. Upon failing to complete it (I tore it up and tossed it), we got a 2nd survey which went the way of the 1st. I got 2 phone calls and told both census workers that the ACS is unconstitutional and I was not going to answer any questions. I was marked REFUSED on their paperwork. We then got a letter telling us we needed to comply. And then the guys started coming to the door and leaving their little Please call me! Its urgent! notes. We did not go to the door the 1st 3 visits and the guy went to my neighbors house to ask about us. He did not even show an ID and my neighbor was realy suspicious esp since this was at 7:30 PM. We live in a gated community and the census worker was following people in to gain access. Finally my husband, ever the patient man, answered the door. He listened to the spiel and told the guy we were not answering any questions. I was listening just inside the door. This census guy had the audacity to claim that soldiers are dying and somehow that means we should complete the survey! I blew my top and stepped out the door telling the guy how shameful he was to use the death of our troops to try and guilt us into filling out this unconstitutional, 4th Amendment violating piece of garbage. I asked him how it would help build highways to know how many toilets I have! He, of course like all of them, stated this is MANDAtTORY and we could be fined. I told him NO one has been fined. He said we would be receiving something via Fed Ex which has not arrived yet.<br> This is an absolute outrage that people are being bullied, threatened and coerced into filling out information that I wouldnt give to my family members! It is time we resisted this kind of govt intrusion into our lives.</p>

                 <p>I wouldnt count on contact with your legislators helping. I contacted my Republican Congressman and his office said there was nothing they could do for me. I needed to comply with the survey. I didnt even bother contacting my Democratic Senators. The best thing is just try and avoid/ignore the Census Bureau. They will eventually go away.</p>

             <p>This is a follow-up to the adventures with my Census stalker. She and the Census bureau are now well aware of the consequences of trespassing on my property again. To review, I did and still do have the home address of my Census stalker. You should have seen the look on her face when a letter warning her to stay off my property was delivered. Priceless. She gets the picture now. Be free my fellow Americans.</p>

             <p>I received the ACS in Sept. 2011. Ignored the original and the second copy. Received several phone<br> calls at various times of the day. Then I found this discussion forum and used the sample letter above.<br> The next time I was called I told them Id just recently returned the survey. I then mailed the letter with the<br> unanswered survey and havent heard back from them since then (7 months). I also wrote to my Rep.<br> two state Senators. Only one had a staffer call to discuss it. I read them the letter and and quoted ICC<br> vs. Brimson. It ended with the staffer saying they would investigate the language on the ACS to see if<br> it could be regarded as a subpoena. Havent heard back from them yet. Subpoena, heck! Anything<br> addressed to resident cant possibly be regarded as a subpoena. My advice is to print the sample letter,<br> sign it An American Citizen and send it back with the unanswered survey. That should stop all calls and<br> visits.</p>

                 <p>Hello Mike, Pissed Tom here again. I see you are using the hip abbreviated language of youth that stands to reason. Sorry if I have been harsh on you, young man calling you a Weenie and coward and sycophantic. Obviously you are just a youngster and from your statement of helping your country your government to gather statistics, idiot , you must have been steeped in the socialist/collectivist, the government is our friend and Father brainwashing. Ah, youth been there my friend and, thank God, grew to be able to think for myself you should give it a try. Heres lesson #1 Mike its a quote from George Washington, He was a founding father and our very first President Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.. Mike all the people here are trying to do is contain the fire &amp; force of government and doing this by putting their wealth and physical freedom on the line to stand up for what they believe is a fundamental principle, clearly codified in our Constitution.</p> 
                 <p> I am willing to bet you, Mike, you have some line drawn in the sand of you mind and heart that if your government stepped beyond, and encroached upon a right you hold dear, you would be as incensed as these good folks. Yes if it was a clear violation and threat to you, you would be a powerful advocate of Civil Disobedience. Please stay and insult us more if it makes you feel happy. This just might be the place that plants the Liberty seed in the deep, recesses of you mind and heart; the seed of awareness of human sovereignty and civic responsibility to protect and defend our precious, hard won Rights. We will not hold your former ignorance against you!</p>

Today I had a notice of registered mail that the postman tired to delive to me but I was not at home. I think it is probably from them also. Has anyone gotten registered mail from the census goons?

               <p>Yes, I received a letter delivered from the Kansas City office today through Fed Ex! I didnt respond to the two surveys that were sent in the mail because I refuse to give them the information. A field agent showed up on Saturday (6/2)as we were leaving. I dont know why I gave her my cell phone number but she called me 3 times on Tuesday (6/5), stopped by when I wasnt home on Wednesday (6/6), and then stopped by again Saturday (6/9) as we sat in our house and refused to answer the door. My kids know what she looks like and what her car looks like and are nervous anytime the doorbell rings. </p> 
               <p>The letter was dated June 8th so they are being pretty agressive trying to get these answers from us. Ive just drafted a letter to them with the sample from the website and will be mailing it off tomorrow. </p> 
               <p>They need to leave us alone!!</p>

             <p>The harassment has just begun for us. We have received 5 phone calls. The last call I attempted to complete the survey. I provided my name and began answering the questions with I decline to answer. That did not go over well. The ACS worker got her supervisor on the phone. I informed her that I would answer the questions but was told that my answers were not sufficient and the census would not be complete. I stated that if theft would not accept my answers than not to waste my time and I hung up. Got another phone call tonite, priceless!</p>

             <p>Kevin,<br> Thank you for this site. I received the ACS a few months ago. Fed up with government intrusions, I Googled and found this site. Then I copied and pasted the letter to Big Brother and printed it. I sent the letter along with the ACS back with only the date and the number of occupants in my home. I have been receiving calls non-stop for the last month or so. Sometimes two a day. I havent been home to receive any yet. No workers have come to my home yet YET.</p> 
             <p>My guts have been twisted up anticipating that this is how its gonna go down. Reading some of your outstanding comments, I have drawn strength from all of you to see this through. Big Brother wants a fight? Lets give him one. I stand with all of you.</p> 
             <p>I wish you all well. And I wish you all peace from this intrusive government.</p> 
             <p>God Bless all of you, and God Bless America.<br> Please give us the country that our fore-fathers intended us to inherit.</p>

                 <p>Kevin,</p> 
                 <p>I wanted to send an update to everyone When I wrote my last comment at the end of May, the Census Bureau was blowing up my phone at least three to five days a week. About two weeks after the post, all calls stopped. I had a copy of the letter printed and posted by the front door, just in case, with explicit instructions to my wife to give it to them and answer no questions in the event I was not home. Never had any visitors.</p> 
                 <p>I urge all of you to stand by your principles and stay strong. I wish you all success in your personal endeavor to maintain privacy from our over-reaching government. God bless you all and God bless America.</p> 
                 <p>A citizen of the United States of America</p>

                   <p>I am going to implement Kevins letter and also when the worker arrives I am going to compel him/her to fill out PUBLIC SERVANT QUESTIONAIRE before I will agree to answer any questions. It can be found here. <a href="http://www.patriotnetwork.info/APS_7-PubServQuest.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.patriotnetwork.info/APS_7-PubServQuest.htm</a> .</p> 
                   <p>After he/she fills it out completely to my satisfaction I will politely hand him/her a copy of Kevins letter and inform him/her I have no intentions of answering any questions on that form but thank you very much and good day. If they insist or get nasty or threatning the camcorder will immediately be turned on. In fact after some slight thought I think I will bring out the camcorder from the gate go. Ha Ha </p> 
                   <p>I saw a post on another sight where the person wrote he declined to answer the questions but the worker gave him oral sex and then he complied. Tell me where will they stop with their underhanded dirty tactics to bully me into submission?</p>

             <p>WellI started receiving calls this week a day after we received our letter which was on Tuesday of this past week stating that the survey would be arriving shortly, well here it is Friday and we got the dreaded Survey. Times like these I really do wish I lived in TX!! Annie, git your gun!</p> 
             <p>I work at home and am on my property for most of the day. I am reading all of your posts on how to deal with these bozos. What I am fearful of is that I live in Rhode Island and its pure liberal mania here. I doubt that my police will do anything to help me when the dreaded time(s) does come to pass. However, I feel much better reading all of your posts and gaining so much insight on how to fight back against these intrusive maggots.</p> 
             <p>Thank you for all of your valuable insight and will use the letter. God speed to all of you, you wonderful Freedom Fighters, we cant let them get us down! We must continue to shed light on the darkness they try to impose on us. Please wake me up out of this nightmare!</p>

             <p>Our small business (4 employees) has to date (6-7-12) received three mailed copies of the multi-page form requesting detailed financial information that the form says should only take a few hours(!) to fill out. The 3rd copy came registered (I signed before realizing what it was). All went into the circular file. Now the phone calls have started  three in the past couple of weeks.</p> 
             <p>Interestingly the last call was from some outside service contracted by Commerce to harass people. They took down that we REFUSED the information. I told her wed provide it if a federal judge signed a search warrant or subpoena. If any person has the chutzpah to visit our office, Im ready with a video camera and a sincere promise to make them a YouTube star.</p>

             <p>What a great site. After receiving my ACS survey, I decided to have some fun. Being a 49 yr old menopausal female in flyover country, I quickly lost my train of thoughtgot POd and threw it in the burn barrell. Dittos for the second. Now the phone calls have started, thank God for caller ID. Im just waiting for someone to try to come to my house (google maps takes them across a cow path with a washed out bridge LOL) My NO TRESSPASSING sign are posted, I just hope Im home if they actually show up, maybe Ill sick the goose on them. Thanks for the info, and yes Ill be taking the 5th</p>

             <p>They started bugging us about 2 months ago. Post card saying it was on the way<br> then we got the 1st survey. After reading it we were all creeped out with the questions. Then the 2nd one showed up with even more papers in the packet.<br> A friend of mine know a MI state rep and he said not to send it in and tell them<br> not to come to the house because they would then be trespassing . After the 3rd call I bravely answered the phone. I told the lady I wasnt going to send it in and that I had sent the 2010 census and there was no reason for all the personal information. After all this she then tells me why the need the information and what they use it for. She then asks me if I would like to do the survey over the phone!!! Are you kidding me? I repeated it all over again MAM, I said IM NOT DOING IT!! She then says she will mark me down as REFUSED. Thinking its all over and 4 days later I got another paper in the mail. Dear resident we hope you will give us your very personal and private information and trust us no one else<br> with see it!! I guess its not over yet. My sons have mail ordered quite a bit of ammunition in the last year. I have wonder if this raised a red flag with BIG BROTHER and started this mess.</p>

             <p>My experience is much the same as everyone else. I did not respond to the first survey I received. I returned the second survey with only name, address and number of residents. I have received 3 phone calls. The first two they left messages on our voice mail. Unfortunately, the third call I actually answered. The caller spoke english poorly and was difficult to understand. Again, I only confirmed our address and the number of residents. I refused to answer any of the other questions. I said I didnt understand why I was being required to provide information that is either personal or that the Federal Government already has (IRS-income, occupation, etc). She read her script to me. I replied, So, youre telling me that as a free U.S. citizen, I dont have the right to refuse giving out my personal information. Again, script reading. We ended finally by me stating that I refused to answer any questions other than to confirm the info that I gave originally.</p>

             <p>In the last 10 months I recieved four surveys, none of which I completed. On June 1, 2012 a man showed up at my door and told me I had to take the survey. I told him that it was none of their business, they wanted health information, and told him to leave. On Wednesday, June 6, I recieved a letter to resident from Fedex. Today someone else showed up at my door and argued with me about the survey. She told me I could give her a made up name I didnt have to use my own. I told her NO that I would not comply and she gave me her business card and said I had to call her supervisor to get them to stop coming. I will call from work tomorrow as I am not going to use my home phone or cell for them to start harassing me on those. I told her this is a big waste of tax dollars and she just said she was trying to do her job. Is this one of the jobs Obama is bragging about creating? I will post again if they come back.</p>

             <p>Hello, everyone</p> 
             <p>I enjoyed reading this piece as it gives me a bit of empowerment and now know that Im not alone in this turmoil. It is quite scary and a challenge when you have to face the monstrosity that it is the US Government. But whats the worse that can happen? Can they make me disappear? Hmmm, Ive heard of things happening like that in other countries. But not in the US, oh no no no.</p> 
             <p>Today was the second time I spoke with an ACS employee after so many ignored phone calls. I made the mistake of sending the survey with my households names and age, leaving everything else blank. Now they call to complete the survey to which I tell them is an intrusion of my familys privacy. </p> 
             <p>During our discussion, I told the lady that no one in my family gives any type of information through the phone, let alone a government agency. She said it was safe and that my information would not be shared by any other government agencies or third parties.</p> 
             <p>I tell her that the only way I would give some information is if they send someone with a badge and perhaps Ill think about answering the questions. She said, We will not send anyone over because your survey is partially complete. She also needed my permission to access my information. </p> 
             <p>She started to hang up and tag me as refused when I turned the tables on her and asked, how would you like it if someone threaten you with something if you dont give your personal information? Scary isnt it? Sounds like something you would see in the movies or read about in history books with dictators and all that good stuff. She said, Sir, I will not discuss any further matter with you, Ill just note that you refuse to comply, have a good day. </p> 
             <p>I feel lonely and powerless, because I live in a community where it seems everyone is complacent with whatever the government mandates. Not to mention how people around here revere the president and other elected officials as gods. </p> 
             <p>What to do now?</p>

             <p>I just sent out my survey. I only put the date and the number of occupants along with the cover letter. Its time to wait and see what happens. Reading through some of the comments it seems Ive got a fight ahead of me. Its sad it ha to come to this in our supposed modern and free society, but it wouldnt be the first time Americans have had to fight for these rights.</p>

                 <p>Hi:</p> 
                 <p>From what Ive read they can charge you $100.00- $500.00 per unanswered question. $100 if its just unanswered and up to $500.00 if Its answered wrong. If you must send the document in, it is better to put Decline to answer as your answers.<br> That being said, they (everyone knows who they is) dont think they can win in court the way the law is written now. Note the word now. So they have not been pressing charges. Reason being that the dept. of commerce must petition the dept. of justice to bring criminal charges. And lots of organizations and lawyers and civil rights groups are waiting to challenge this law in court. So more power to you. If they charge you there will be a whole lot of people behind you. The last thing they want is for this dark instrument of bureaucratic deceit to be brought into the bright light of justice, or any other light for that matter. I have never seen one iota about this survey on the mainstream media.</p>

             <p>I have been sent two ACS so far. We dont answer phone calls when we dont know who is calling so we cant be harassed that way. Now we have received 2 notices at our door after been paid visits from a representative. Amazing they spelt census censos which really gives one confidence in a note to us.. I copied the template letter and have it posted by our front door. In reading I saw the House voted to get rid of the ACS recently. The Senate will be another story .</p>

             <p>This web page is a godsend!<br> We were first contacted sometime in February or March 2012 to answer the Census. I was only willing to tell the woman census taker that 2 adults were residing in our home. I explained to her, that is all I am required to divulge. We live in a very remote area and this loon had driven up to our house 5 separate times.<br> About 6 weeks ago, they started calling our house, sometimes 2 or 3 calls in one day. They even called on Sunday evenings. The message was always the same, please contact the Census Bureau.. No one ever left the long form, but I am assuming that that is why I am being harassed.<br> I am so grateful for the info that Kevin Hayden has provided. It gave me the needed information to write a great letter about my constitutional rights.<br> Hope this puts an end to the harassment.</p>

             <p>Just found this site. Got 2 surveys that I shredded then the calls started on June 1. After 2 weeks I got the bright idea of having their number forwarded to my fax machinehahaha. Once they got an ear full of fax noise they started calling from a new number and thus I had that one also forwarded. Now I dont hear their calls unless I am in the office. It is now June 23 and they still are calling. One thing I did notice on the shredded survey was I did not see a deadline when it has to be filled out by? Has anyone else noticed this or did I miss it? As far as I am concerned if there is not a deadline then I can tell them I will get to it when I have time and right now I am too busy working my butt off to pay for all the money they are stupidly spending. Not sure if I will answer the door when they come calling or not.</p>

               <p>They do eventually go away. We ignored phone calls that began when we did not send in the survey, but after finding this blog happily took a call and told them we were not going to fill out the survey or give any information over the phone, and that I would be most glad to provide them with the name and phone number of my attorney who represents me in this (no, I do not have one but they did not know that). Anyway, they did not want that information. Next they made a couple of house calls; not home for the first, the housekeeper was there for the second. Then all of a sudden no more calls, no more house visits. Guess we fell through the cracks. This all in about a 30-day period.</p>

             <p>I have received my third request from the US Dept of Commerce Economics and statistics Adm US Census Bureau.. It states clearly that it is required by law under Title 13 of the US Code. It says that i can be fined if i dont.. The survey is requesting specific dollar amounts of income derived from various government payments for medicare and workers compensation billings. The cover letter is from Mark E. Wallace, Chief, Service Sector Statistics Division.</p> 
             <p>Nowhere can i find any specific fines described for non-compliance with the filling out of the 2011 Annual Services Report Ive received two phone calls from the Census Bureau. </p> 
             <p>I guess I am unaware of whether or not I am actually obligated to fill in their survey. I closed my private practice last year and am inclined to settle in for the long haul with the Census Bureau folks. any suggestions would be appreciated</p>

               <p>Based on my experience your calls will go on for a month. As you can read above I eventually had them forwarded to my fax machine. I expect them to start beating on my door soon. I got rid of my forms. I looked and did not find a deadline to fill out. Did you find one? If they did not include a deadline, to me that is an easy out.

             <p>Im sorry, Im a bit confused. Should I provide the number of residents in the cover letter? Or should I provide that on the front of the actual form (<a href="http://d.pr/i/TEQQ" rel="nofollow">http://d.pr/i/TEQQ</a>)? You (Kevin) say that you reveal the number of residents in the home in the COVER LETTER, but I dont see that in the template letter youve provided us to use. ??</p> 
             <p>Note: I also plan on providing the date in the date field. I figured thats harmless enough.</p>

             <p>Well folks, shes coming back tomorrow, glad I found this site, I never actually received the form (my physical address is different from my mailing address)! I found some leaflet at my door two weeks ago, and she showed up last Wednesday, walking all around the outside of the house yelling HELLOOOO! I went outside, asked who the heck she was, and did she not notice the three NO TRESPASSING signs, she said she did, but that this ACS survey is required by law! I guess that trumps private property rights! I told her we sent in the Census in 2010, as required, with the number of occupants (head count). She said that every sixth occupancy gets the ACS Survey randomly! I told her we never got the forms, she replied that it was too late for that now and proceeded to open up her laptop to start entering any info I might give her..I told her that I will not be giving any info to her to put into a laptop, as I dont know where or what site she might be logged into. She refused to give me the form, so I said, well, (1) occupant resides here, NOW GO!<br> Now, with info in hand, I will just copy and paste this form letter, put in in an envelope, put my address on the outside of it, and mark its return address as resident, and hand it to her, if she refuses it, I will send it to the Census Bureau (registered), NOT to ACS!</p>

             <p>This is great. Thank you all for the info. I have recieved 2 census forms and 2 cards informing me that its the law. My house is 1/4 mile off the road in the middle of nowhere. I have NO TRESSPASSING signs everywhere. I was pissed before I knew what these sureveys were about. I cant wait to see if someone shows up here, I have 5 dogs and one is never happy to see visitors. Its also hot here and I run around in my underware most of the time, I wont be dressing up for them. Yep, Im a hermit, thats all they need to know.</p>

               <p>omgnever thought of thatweve received two of the letters (packet with questionaire). I didnt respond. Now the phone calls have started. Never thought about how they got my phone number. Both times have been Sat. morning. This morning was the 2nd call. I had told her previously that I would only answer no. of people in this home. I told her I needed more time to research the legality. Got a letter in the mail yesterday with a copy of title 13then a call this morning. I told her I was busythey are going to call me back on Monday. Are they getting overtime to do this on the weekend? anyway, going to print this out so I have it on hand Monday morning</p>

             <p>I worked for the 2010 Census. We were trained extensively. It appears that most of the census workers did not understand and do not know the law. We are not allowed to violate No Tresspassing signs without obtaining permission from the owner first. Homeowners should call the Sheriff on violators. We are required to attempt contact until the resident gives refusal. We are not allowed to make threats. After refusal, we are to attempt to get the information from a neighbor. The minimum amount of info is the number of occupants. If a neighbor cannot provide this number, the census worker is told to make an estimate. The best thing for paranoid people to do is complete the form with only the info you wish to share, then write refused on everything else. We are not allowed to ask the neighbors for info once you have responded (even with partial refusal).</p>

               <p>Dear Census Worker:</p> 
               <p>The 2010 census is not the same as the American Community Survey. Have you not received one?? It is a blatant intrusion on everyones privacy. I hope enough people are intelligent enough to nip this travesty of our rights in the bud. But alas, the american people put these pirannas in office in the first place. We are now reaping what was sown. Is it too late for us?</p>

             <p>The mailings began in April of this year. 3 postcards, a preview brochure with instructions then 2 survey forms sent 6 weeks apart. I didnt respond and then the phone calls came, 8 in all (that I counted) I never answered them as i have caller ID. Then 2 semi-educational / threatening letters trying to compel me to return the completed form. Then a visit by a census worker (I was not at home) She left a nice note. Then a stern FedEx letter. This is when I printed off the sample letter from your website and tailored it to my situation. No names, just our address and how many people reside here. Today (just moments ago) the very kind middle aged woman knocked on my door and tried to gently persuade me to answer her questions. I insisted (kindly) 3 times that I refused to do so. I told her that I had sent the survey back to the Census Bureau with my letter of protest and that I was not angry with her, but I absolutely refuse to answer the questions in this survey and cited the constitution of the U.S. as my source. She was visibly disappointed (possibly because she has a quota to keep and may have a nasty supervisor to answer to). I said that I know she must do her job and to proceed with whatever next steps were at her disposal. She kindly let me know that the Dept of Commerce is not an enforcement agency and that any fines or penalties are not pursued by their office. (Im not sure if this means Ill be hearing from another branch of the government). In the end she was very kind and without aggression. I was pleased that this worker seemed to be doing her job without malice towards me. Can anyone tell me what might be next in the process for me?<br> Thanks so much for this website. It has been extremely informative and helpful to me.</p>

               <p>I received one last visit from a Census worker about one week after my last visit. This gentleman was from CA (thats what his card said) and he was sent with the last possible hope of persuading me to comply with the survey. I very politely declined. He stated that the report on me was that I was very kind and polite but also very firm in my objection. He said that he was the last person that would be visiting me.

The visits started two weeks ago, the first was Sunday, 08 July 2012 &amp; she showed-up yesterday &amp; today; two of those visits she left the same information about how it had to be filled-out &amp; her card, today she just sat in her car for a while after the door was not answered (if she wants to sit in her car in the humid Georgia seat, fine with me because I have AC on the inside). Then she managed to get my unlisted phone number &amp; called last night but did not leave a message (thank God for Caller I.D.).</p> 
             <p>Tonight I am going to post the letter on our front door &amp; send a copy to the appropriate address, &amp; ask my Godfather what the laws are in Georgia about harassment &amp; private property rights.</p>

               <p>You should contact your phone company and do the following, change your number make sure it is non published and use a initial other than your first name along with your last name when callers ask for directory assistance with the address omitted. Do not authorize giving them permission for other carriers to obtain that information and have the telco place a block on collect and third party billed calls. Then place a password on your account and have them write in their notes no information without password. </p> 
               <p>If the census calls you on the new number, you can then take the phone company to court for violating your CPNI usage records. By law, they cannot obtain that information without a subpoena. It is very important that the omit the address when someone calls 411 to ask for your number. Telcos still operate like I need a listing in Houston, Tx last name Doe first name John, operator will say I have a John Doe on 123 Main Street you want that one, followed by At the Customers Request the number is Non Published and is not a part of our Records You want the operator to say we have a J Doe with no address, you want that one followed by At the Customers Request the number is Non Published and is not a part of our Records see the error you made?</p>

Last week he showed up again. As I was out working in my yard I had to acknowledge him. I asked what he wanted and who he was. He said he was from the Census Bureau. I told him I had already filled out my census form a long time ago and sent it in. He said he had a survey for me to take. I told him I was not interested multiple times. Finally he left.

             <p>I just received my ACS in the mail yesterday. I am always suspicious of ANYONE requesting such personal information, but since the letter attached said that my response was required by law I decided to start filling it out. As I got further into the survey I became more and more uncomfortable with the information that was being requested. I really did not want to the fill this out and send it in. I got through the personal information for my husband and decided to google for information about the ACS and what my potential punishment would be if i refused to send it in. Luckily, I found this website and all of the comments. I have ripped out the staples and put this survey through my shredder. With the website information and the comments left by other concerned citizens, I feel empowered and moved to some civil disobedience. </p> 
             <p>I have copied your cover letter into a word document and will be saving this website for reference should I be harassed by any census/government workers. Good luck everybody!</p>

               <p>We also started to fill out the forms and then felt very uncomfortable and shredded. I made a phone call to ACS and said we did not want to participate and felt like they were setting us up for Obamacare. Then a second form came. We never answered phone calls whom we didnt know were calling. No messages were ever left. We were paid 4 visits with the last one being June 26th. We were never home. To busy working to pay for others whom dont. Now for the last 4 weeks there has been silence. Is it the end????? Or is the bomb coming yet. All I can say is hang in there. The invasion of the information wanted is none of their business. I have done lots of reading and from my understanding there are outsiders that want this information we provide also. They might even add more questions like what is your sexual preference in the future. Where does it stop? If needed government it could obtain lots of the information through real estate tax bills and income taxes we file. They want it all in one nice lump sum for themselves. Are we chosen at random? I am self employed and not one single client of mine has ever heard of the ACS. I did let a couple of my state representatives know how I felt. One responded with a generic letter and the other didnt answer. Dont give up and get the word out there. This nonsense is more wasted money by our government.</p>

             <p>1. I am glad I found this site  the level of stress this has caused is costing me productivity  I am self employed in a non regular compensation field.<br> 2. Ive also been a victim of identity theft  enough said on that.<br> 3. I do not have the time to do a fiscal year schedule C to answer their income questions.<br> 4. I am wondering if it is better to not even give them the form [blank/partially/or completed with written explanation i.e. do not have sufficient information to complete in allowable time. or<br> 5. To give them the letter only or post the letter on my door.<br> 6. I too contacted my congressman with no response.<br> 7. I contacted my state Attorney General who replied in an e-mail to me that there are few questions that you do not have to answer and that I have to contact the census bureau to get the numbers of those questions. Then when I recontacted them asking for which questions, they responded with that they did not know and I would have to call the CB. I do not even want to call these people from any phone. All of my phone numbers are on the national do not call list. I have enough stress in my life and do not want to add more. </p> 
             <p>8. I did contact my local police and was told by the female officer that she would not fill it out either. I wanted to find out my rights and what I need to do if they start to show up at my door, pound on the doors, windows, not let me leave or I feel threatened  and I was told to call them. They also advised that I hang a no-soliting and a no tresspassing sign on my property in at least two places of access.</p> 
             <p>9. I also resent the fact that I may have to spend money I do not have if they decide to fine me. Does anyone know of any sites where attorneys are working on this, bro-bono?</p>

               <p>Anne MarieTake a deep breath.<br> I was all bent out of shape by the thing when I first received<br> it too. As I filled it out, I realized that most of it didnt apply<br> to me. The worst part was trying to figure out the financial part<br> of it. If you are self employed you are probably ahead of the<br> game since you probably keep disciplined records.<br> And if you are a bit sloppy in that area, then just take a wild-ass<br> guess. Its not like this is going to trigger an audit.<br> (at least I hope not !)</p>

             <p>I just got the stupid thing and filled it out.<br> At first I thought it was just part of some new<br> scam since it had the Bold Printed:<br> YOUR RESPONSE IS REQUIRED BY LAW<br> Hey, I didnt do anything, what is this crap?<br> Leave me alone.<br> Any mail I receive that says<br> things like Important Open Immediately on the<br> envelope usually goes straight into the garbage.<br> But I opened it anyway just to see what the hell it was.<br> Next I read that I had to fill the thing out OR ELSE.<br> Or else what? Was I going to be shipped off to one<br> of the camps or just be put on the No Fly List?<br> I quickly thumbed through the pages all the while<br> muttering What the f.? ..What? What is this?<br> So I searched on line to see what the penalty was<br> for being a leave-me-alone-slacker<br> $5,000 !!!!! What the livin f is that?<br> So I took a deep breath and started wading through the thing.<br> It took a lot more than 38 minutes to complete.<br> I found it somewhat intrusive and annoying because it<br> reminded me of the yearly April 15th ordeal they put<br> us through. Once a year of that is enough.<br> It turns out that the questions I had to answer,<br> werent all that intrusive after all. Since I had dutifully<br> jumped through the IRS hoops in April, I wasnt paranoid<br> that this was some kind of big gummamint trick trying<br> to trip me up. The really annoying part was having to<br> go back through my records and account for my rent, utilities,<br> vehicles, interest, and other incomes and all that stuff.<br> Not everyone keeps really good records of these things.<br> I remember a time when just filling out a 1040-EZ was a stressful ordeal.<br> Fortunately for me, as I got older and more responsible,<br> I got disciplined ( or conditioned) enough to keep fairly accurate records<br> But even still I had to gather up all of that information and then<br> do the calculations. That ate up most of my afternoon.<br> I think I should be paid for my time. In fact I think anyone<br> who fills this thing out should be paid for their efforts<br> (not to mention punitive damages for the temporary elevations<br> of their blood pressure).<br> Now, Im not greedy, but I think a nice, crisp<br> check for $100 from the Census Bureau<br> would be in order. (And no, I am not worried that<br> this is a communist plot by the Illuminati or some<br> insidious Obama-care effort to try to force us to take any unwanted enemas.<br> The banksters have already done that.)</p>

             <p>I think some of the questions on this survey DO go<br> a bit overboard and I understand why people are reluctant<br> to answer them. I understand the need for any government<br> to obtain information about what is going on out in the hinterland,<br> but there is a limit to how much people are going to allow their<br> privacy to be invaded. It make them feel vulnerable. And so should<br> they be.

               <p>In addition the immense invasion of privacy, what really bothers me is that many of the questions could be answered with very little research. The amount of money paid on various blls could be obtained anonymously from various public utilities for example. I suspect the government would spend less of the taxpayers money by obtaining information this way. I also DO NOT trust anyone using the internet to keep my private information private. Also, I am one person so my small amount of information is pretty useless.</p>

             <p>My telephone harassment started this evening with Mr. James Muller. After verifying everything he asked if I sent in my survey. I told him that it states to do it as soon as possible and it is on my honey-do list. I actually got a chuckle out of him. He said that I could do a phone interviewbut I was too busy. I dont have caller-id and answer all calls because my husband is looking for a job. Since he is currently deployed, I do not answer the door to anyone I dont know so they can just ring the bell and stand there. Thank you for your letter. I printed and will mail it tomorrow with the blank surveyjust so I can say I sent it in. If they wait long enough to visit me they will get a face full of PTSD from my soldier, which wouldnt be a bad thing.</p>

             <p>I am in the same boat as everyone else here. Received the long ACS form because I refused to answer the census due to their requirement for very personal information. Had a census taker show up at my house a few mos back, told them one person lived here, and told them Any other personal information is confidential, and a I refuse to answer any more Qs</p> 
             <p>Fast forward to today, and an ACS agent from Atlanta (Mind you I am in Charlotte) showed up while I was gone today. Needless to day, they dont give up and will keep harassing me until they get what they want. They wont get it, they will be getting a copy of the letter on this website informing them of my rights (Thanks for the form letter!). In addition, the guberment could be spending the money on roads and other needed projects instead of having all these people running around collecting a cushy salary and harassing the H#LL out of hard working Americans!</p> 
             <p>I have been a IT Network Security Professional for the past x# of years and have worked on critical e-commerace for years. I do NOT trust the govt to keep ANY personal information safe, little lone send a form with a census taker that has ALL of my personal information on it. All someone has to do is break into their car and they have everything they need to commit fraud.</p> 
             <p>As others have mentioned, return a form letter with the # in your household, that is all they need period.</p> 
             <p>PS- Thanks for providing this website and informing others, it is appreciated by all!</p>

               <p>UPDATE: </p> 
               <p>They are relentless, even after I included the form letter with one mailed back version of the survey, I included an other copy of the survey and stuck it in the door to be picked up. The Census take picked it up, but has returned with a message card:<br> I am sorry I keep missing you. I am trying to make contact with someone at this resident regarding a mandatory survey that was sent to be completed by this household. A better understanding letter was requested and hopefully you received it and are willing to at least talkt to me or my supervisor regarding your concerns or questions you might have. NOT making contact with the agency will see you as refusing to complete the survey and I will send a refusal letter. Please call so this can be prevented. Thank You.</p> 
               <p>A: I am NOT sorry I missed her again.<br> B: I started to get a call from her, and said Wrong number, I dont appreciate tele-marketing calls and hung up. Have not been called again for a week. How the H@ll did they get a cell #? Then again, they are goveco.<br> C: What happens when they send a refusal letter? back to Corp</p>

             <p>It does appear that they do finally give up. I got two surveys, multiple calls but no home visits at least not yet. Its now been about 6 weeks with no harassmentI am still on the lookout for them. On another subjecthave you gone for your yearly check-up and been asked to fill out the medicare accessment questionairemore of the samejust x-out all 4 pages and write REFUSED.</p>

             <p>That last e mail was sent incomplete so let me finish here. Thank you Mr Hayden for your excellent research. I will not respond to this survey and I will be standing by for when the census cop comes to call. I will post the property NO TRESASSING and have the cam corder ready. I will ask the survey taker their name address and date of birth. Then I will order them off the property and call 911 for local law enforcment demanding prosecution f they do not leave. </p>

             <p>Question. . .what do we do if we have posted a No Trespassing sign prominently in the front yard and they walk right past it and still come in the yard and leave materials? This happened to us the other day (not home at the time; came home and found the brochure/business card stuck in between our garage door and the weatherproofing strip around the garage door)? They had to walk right by the neon colored sign! </p> 
             <p>We have read over everyones suggestions and found an additional Supreme Court case (just by chance or maybe we were guided to find it): </p> 
             <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that individuals generally maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in their bodies, clothing, and personal belongings. Homeowners possess a privacy interest that extends inside their homes and in the curtilage immediately surrounding the outside of their homes, but not in the open fields and wooded areas extending beyond the curtilagesee Hester v. United States, 265 U.S. 57 [1924]. </p> 
             <p>We will also be adding to our letter (to keep on hand if they ambush us) that , this intrusive survey raises on our part a Fourth Amendment objection that the rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment are personal:</p> 
             <p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<br> (and then we quoted the aforementioned SC case)</p> 
             <p>Also, we intend to include in our letter a copy of the general offenses codes for both our state and city/county if they trespass again. </p> 
             <p>Just some suggestions. . .we know that they will continue to hound us but we believe that we have the Constitution on our side and will continue to refuse to answer this highly offensive/intrusive surveyall they will get out of us is the number of folks living here (which we had already provided them with in 2010) and nothing else until the next legal census in 2020!</p>

               <p>Just had an afterthought. . .why not turn the tables on them. </p> 
               <p>As we mentioned above, the surveyor trespassed into our yard despite the fact that we have a sign posted front and center for all to see. Still, he left his brochure with his business card and phone number. We googled his name and phone number and find out where he lives, his age, his wifes name, when he bought his home and for how much, his taxes, the names of his neighbors, how long hes lived in our community and what other communities he has lived in. </p> 
               <p>We printed off copies of all his info, which is free and readily available on the world wide web (not like we had to join any sites either like Linked IN or subscribe to anything either, just typed his name and phone number and the rest was revealed) and if we are ambushed (say while working out in our front yard) and if he refuses to leave, after informing him that well be calling the police because hes trespassing, well also politely mention that he should know what the criminal trespass laws are in our community since he lives at xxxx Lane and proceed to tell him all that we know about him and see how he likes having a total stranger know so much about him! </p> 
               <p>Many of you have mentioned that you too have received a name/phone number from the person showing up at your doorwhy not check them out on the webits free; its obtained legally; its there for the whole world to search for (as is our info, which is the point of this that the govt already knows everything about us). </p> 
               <p>P.S. Have you ever googled yourselfits actually un-nerving what info is out there about each and everyone of us ?</p>

             <p>I first got the ACS long form mailed out to Resident from the Commerce Dept with all the bs questions months ago. I trashed it thinking it was sent for the previous tenant who had a business since it was sent from the Commerce Dept. Got a 2nd one and trashed it again. I then got a letter mailed out to resident that it was a reminder to fill the ACS and send it in. I then started getting knocks on my door which I didnt think much of since it might be solicitors selling things. I never answer the door unless I am expecting someone or a package. Of course Im ready if it was a burglar and that would be the last home they enter in this life. I saw the silly note wedged into the door and the frame saying Sorry we missed you and the ACS is important. Again more knocks on the door the next week and more notes wedged into the door and frame. I just left the letters wedged in the door thinking they would just drive by. I just wonder if they did that a few days. I got no knocks on the door for almost a week, but now they are still knocking even with it there. I finally got a letter in the mail addressed to my name. I know the leasing office of my place gave out my information. I dont blame them because Im sure they showed their badge and threatened them about interfering with the gov bs. I started getting 877 area code phone calls here and there. Just like not answering my door, if I dont recognize someone calling me on the caller ID I dont answer and let it go to voice mail. Here is the funny part: my cellphone rings (vibrate mode) and I dont answer and it goes to voice mail. 30 secs later I get a knock. So I now know its them. I go to Google Voice and now selected BLOCK CALLER. End of phone calls from at least that phone number:) In the past week they came on a Friday and Sunday around 8PM. They once showed up twice on a Saturday two weeks ago. First at 4PM and again at about 8PM. A few days ago they knocked on my neighbors door before knocking on mine. I know the neighbor answered the door and Im sure they asked him about me. THIS IS NOW PISSING ME OFF WHEN THEIR SO CALLED FN CONFIDENTIAL BS IS NOT SO CONFIDENTIAL. THE FN HYPOCRACY. Must they ask neighbors about what time you come home so you can stake out a persons house? These morons came to my place at 1PM today. Seems they are trying different times of the day. Does the Gov have this much money, man power, and resources to waste bother people by driving around when they could have asked for ONE FN volunteer from 300+ other residents at my complex and offering at least a $10 gift certificate to somewhere instead? Im sure they would get a line of volunteers if they did that. They would also save soooooooooo much money and time. Idiots who claim people should fill this out and send it in have no clue that LAPTOPS FROM THE CENSUS WERE LOST/STOLEN IN THE PAST. Of course this WILL continue in the future as well. This is one lottery you dont want to win.</p>

               <p>Forgot to mention that all their envelopes and business cards they leave wedged on your door between the door and the frame are at eye level and none of the envelopes are ever sealed. They leave it open. I think I will place a small trash can with all the business cards and envelopes they have left in front of my door. I will place a sign saying please leave all Census related material below for recycling, Thank You. I will also leave my own check in form with an application for the Census workers, name, birth dates, address, phone numbers, salary, etc, with a sign in form and time and date they came to my place. I hope they send me the Fedex envelope people are talking about, I will never pick it up. Last, I think I will also put a sign on my door saying CENSUS BUREAU PLEASE FINE ME $5000 AND LET ME BE THE POSTER CHILD AS THE FIRST PERSON EVER FINED FOR REFUSING THE CENSUS.

                 <p>First of all this is beyond belief, asking personal questions that I dont even tell my Children or Grandchildren. Where the hell are we going in this Country? Any mail that I receive addressed to Occupant I dump in the recycle bin. So needless to say I have not responded to the survey. Phone calls have started, and my other half just tells them that we are on the no-call list, and stop calling (click). My next course of action is to answer the phone &amp; act like I am mentaly challenged (you know Senior Brain Farts), and string them along with dumb questions &amp; answers, (IE: name-Willy Wonka, occupation-I forgot, how many people occupy the home-I lost count since they come in thru the door cracks in the night, ask them if they are sending me my refund check, who is this I forgot who I called?), until THEY hang up due to frustration and log in their record that I am a Nut Case!!! The moral is Dont screw with a law obiding, worked all his life &amp; paid taxes, and served his CountrySenior</p>

             <p>Well, a different field agent was out today around 645pmwalked right past our No trespassing sign and rang our bellwe did not answer the door (video camera wasnt ready to go). Left her business card taped to our front door and said that she needed our help. We eventually brought the card in the house and Googled her/her phone number and low and behold, we see that not only does she work for the Census Bureau but she is also a member of our Countys Dem. Party Central Committeeno wonder they wont give up. Why do these people think that the No Trespassing sign doesnt apply to them? Fortunately, I have the receipt to show the police as to when I bought it and when theyve been trespassing in our yard. We are getting sick and tired of thisany suggestionsthanks!</p>

               <p>Dear Todd: The fine is 500.00 dollars for EACH question answered falsly. It is better to answer Decline to answer or Refuse to answer . Then they cant say you lied or left the question blank. BTW people I get booted off the net alot on this site. Soooooooo Big brother has his eye on it. And poor people like me who use the dialup connect are the first to get screwed. The Govt. always screws the poor and defenseless first under the guise of being benificial to them. And nowadays whats left of the middle class is the poor and defenseless.</p>

             <p>Census worker actually had the audacity to come to my house at 8:50pm on a Sunday night. I am so glad that I found this website! Cant wait to hand him the form letter!

             <p>Supposedly my ordeal with them is over. Got the usual mailings (ignored every one of them), then the phone calls (ignored them too) and then the drive-bys started. They began leaving cards on the door claiming with the usual its the law and you could be fined language in them. I ignored them too. </p> 
             <p>My neighbor, a criminal defense attorney, told me to tell them to leave and then call the police the next time they showed up. I was all ready to do this. I even talked to the police myself and they pretty much said the same thing. The census worker has no right to invade your privacy if you tell them to leave.</p> 
             <p>When I answered the door today, I told him we did not want to answer the questions. He begged to explain himself so I let him. He realized we didnt like the form and offered to only get the information for 7 questions and he would mark us off as completed.</p> 
             <p>He couldnt tell me exactly what they were at first so I told him to go back into his car, identify the 7 questions and then ring the doorbell again when he was ready.</p> 
             <p>The 7 questions (or so) he wanted to know were the number of occupants, their ages (not dates of birth), gender of each, ethnicity, age of the house, number of rooms, number of bedrooms and what the primary fuel was we used for heating. No names, no income levels, not what time we leave the house in the morning or any of that other crap that is included on the rest of the form. Now well see if they insist on any more information. I just hope its over.</p>

                 <p>I would answer the door if they keep coming back and politely inform them of the No Trespassing just in case they failed to see the brightly lettered signs, and that you WILL call the police or Sheriff if they fail to leave your property.</p>

             <p>What a great web site. We are all fortunate! The chance has come to us, in some cases to our very doorstep, to put our beliefs into action. I suppose there are some who are not frightened at all by this. Hahaha, I am not one of them. But what I am more frightened of is the loss of my liberty, my privacy and the integrity of my character and soul as a free man. The last few years I have watched my private business struggle to stay alive. I had hoped by this stage of my life to slow down and focus on the fun aspect of my chosen calling and profession. If that is not the case then so be it I am resolved. The packet from Hell arrived yesterday a little humor folks it was preceded by the introductory, explanation letter and a slick brochure. I had been aware of this survey from the 2010 Census, invasive questionnaire controversy and had already come to the conclusion this was and invasion of private and a direct assault on our constitution. The reasons offered for the need for all this personal information is to implement socialistic programs that I see as flying in the face of the constitutional mandates for the Fed. and the inferred limitations already skillfully touched on by others and the original author. SOAPBOX Rant to follow: Warning!!! To me the present danger is far greater than one survey, but this is what is at hand. As many of you have kindly done, you will hear from me again as things develop. Seems a pattern can be seen in their procedures with some small variation. Intimidation and fear generation is their prime tool. such is the way with Central Control economic tyranny. This was all clearly coming we were warned repeatedly and this is just the tip of a massive iceberg. America is the Titanic and our economy is to be imploded by design and replaced, eventually with a internationally controled monetary cashless system. I will not be a part of any such system. so this is as good a time as any to officially Disobey, the Big Brother collectivist corporatocracy. Some absorbing and informative bedtime reading material: The Creature from Jekyll Island, The Naked Communist, The Naked Capitalist, Nineteen Eighty-Four, The Road to Serfdom, and Tragedy &amp; Hope to start with. God bless you all.</p>

               <p>We are seeing the seeds planted for the Mark of the Beast as described in the Book of Revelations. It began with the little RFID chip that is mandated for your pets. As soon as the chip is perfected the gov. will mandate everyone have one inserted. Already people are having it put in themselves because it can contain their medical info. The chip can contain your whole financial, medical, work history, and anything else they wish to load it with. Thats how they can control the finances of the whole world. Next seed is mandatory health care. You have to go to the doctor even if you dont want to. The doctor is the one who puts the chip in you. And now the collection and centralization of everyones financial and other information pertinent to their plan.</p> 
               <p>The company which developed the technology claims it is not pursuing the develpment of the technology but I dont believe that for one micro second. I think the government has taken over the technology. Since the chip is bio-electric it leaches energy from your own body to operate.<br> It is written that whomever recieves the mark(the chip) will be afflicted with noisome sores all over their bodies. I suspect there is going to be some kind of radiation involved in the operation of the device.</p> 
               <p>You are right to have more to worry about than this measly bullying by a census worker. When they try to mandate me to receive the Digital Angel, thats what its called, they will have to hunt me down with horses, helicoptors and dogs.</p> 
               <p>Thanks for the nice comments, heres the original release in 1999 of the Digital Angel. Keep up the good work struggling for the rights they havent stolen from us yet.</p>

                 <p>Oh, by the way, FYI:</p> 
                 <p>1999 was the same year a democratic congress and president repealed the Glaston/Eagle law written in the 1930s after the great depression. That law was written to keep corporations from becoming too big to fail and it prevented banks from making risky ventures with peoples money. Now here we are one decade later and the economy failed thanks to banks bundeling bad loans and selling them. But they were too big to fail soooooo. They got bailed out and the people of the world got screwed. Some people got very wealthy from it but it was not me. Thanks democrat</p>

                   <p>Sombodys really messing with my connection on this site. I wasnt even finished and it submited then went to another website. I meant to say thank you Democrats!!! Youre so concerned about my welfare even though I do not want welfare. Youre so concerned about my health even though I do not want to go to the doctor. Youre so concerned about my finances even though youve left me with none. Youre so concerned with my life that I shouldnt even be concerned. Right???</p>

             <p>We got the Survey in the mail last week. Just printed out the cover letter and wrote refused on everything in the survey except the date and how many people live here. It will go into the mail Tuesday after Labor Day. Its time to take a stand against tyranny and unlawful violation of our constitutional rights.</p>

             <p>Awesome that I found this site googling on the ACS. I can say, since Ive only received the first request, that I will neither destroy or complete it. It seems after all the reading that returning the cover letter just welcomes a bevy of phone calls to the house. I dont mind going toe-to-toe on the phone or in person, but Ive just got enough going on in life right now that the last thing I need to deal with is an over-intrusive government. </p>

             <p>I got the mailing then another then the green card. Then I received 3 to 5 calls a day for about 6 weeks. Yesterday a guy shows up and I answer the door and he is standing with his business card pressed against my storm door. He says he is from the census bureau and cooperation is mandatory. I laugh. I tell him I am not interested. He asked if I sent in my forms. I say no. He says dont bother now. I say ok. He says I have to answer the questions. I tell him I want to opt out. He says no way. I say oh well. He reaches for the storm door handle and I say that would be a big mistake. I tell him he is not allowed in my house and that I am not answering any questions. He gets in his car and leaves. Next day I see an envelope with info in it stuck to my door with some sticky crap that was hard to remove. The outside of the envelope said something to the effect of under penalty of death I cant tell anyone about this stuff. I laugh because it was stuck to the outside of my door in an open envelope. I refuse to give more info than the Constitution allows. I am a taxpayer, a registered voter and served my country. I have always sent in my legal census with the information required by the constitution. I thought I was singled out because I sent letters to Obama, the drug czar and all the folks in congress about repealing the marijuana prohibition. If you live in Colorado, Washington, or Oregon then be sure to vote for legalization in the Nov. 2012 election to repeal the prohibition and end the insane drug war. I will stand firm when the guy shows up again. Stand strong my brothers and sisters!</p>

             <p>After reading the comments, it appears the survey is going to people with land lines not cell phones. Then after reviewing the questions, they seem more pointed toward older people, which makes sense, more older people have land lines vs cell phones. Older people are traditionaly easier to scare into things, but looking at this group I would say that is not the case. Loves me fiesty folks.</p>

             <p>Received my second form two weeks ago after refusing to respond. Calls started Sunday and one last night. We did not answer. This whole thing is a travesty and I believe that by answering their invasive questions , we are giving up just a little more of our precious liberties. Many of us fought for those liberties and many gave the ultimate sacrifice. I cannot in good conscience give them what they are asking.

             <p>I posted earlier that we had received the first and second questionnaire, the post card, the first phone call where I refused to answer anything other than no. of residents. At that time the gal said she would mark me refused..at that time I told her I am not refusingwould just answer with no response.second call came Sat. morning. I told her I didnt have time (which was true) and she asked for a specific time to call back. We agreed on 10am today. At 10:01 it came in. I asked if I could record our callshe got a bit flustered; said shed never been asked that before, and would have to ask her supervisor. Came back with, yesI guess you can. I put speaker phone on (dont actually have a way to record) She started in again with the questions. I told her to look at the records of the last phone callI would not be answering the questions. I then quoted to her parts of the Article 1, etc. from above.she again got flustered, said shed have to get a supervisor on the phone. Waited for a bit, supervisor came on and tried to get me to answer the questions. I said simplywhat dont you guys understand? Im simply refusing to give out personal information. She said well have to mark you refusedI told her they had done that on the last phone call also..She then said good bye and hung up.guess Id better get a no trespassing sign on my door and at the end of the driveway right awayI did get the name of the first galam going to google her now.,,,,</p>

             <p>Please be aware that your USCB ACS questionnaire is now in refusal status. To avoid being subject to a $500.00 fine, and/or other penalties, it is urgent that you contact me immediately to resolve this matter.</p> 
             <p>A couple of questions: </p> 
             <p>1-would you take this as a threat?<br> 2-what do you think they mean by  now in refusal status (incidentally, we have never acknowledged/talked with any one regarding this survey)<br> 3-wasnt even printed on official CB letter head; appears to have copied and pasted a CB logo on top of this letter.

             <p>Good Afternoon Everyone</p> 
             <p>I have gone through all of the phone calls from the Census Bureau and the house calls and finally decided to lock the gate with a no trespassing sign.</p> 
             <p>This morning I found a FedEx envelope on my gate from the Census Bureau, it was not certified. My question is should a person open the envelope? And if not, what do you do with the envelope, and does anyone know what document is in the envelope?</p>

               <p>We got the FedEx envelope also. It was not certified so they dont know if you got it or not. No proof. Anyone could have picked it up off your gate or it could have blown away .I think it is again more wasted recycling material. Nothing important as I recall. I wouldnt have opened it but my husband did before I knew it came. Now that you got the FedEx I am thinking you are about to the end of your ACS nightmare journey. Good Luck!</p>

               <p>Larry, I would not open it myself. I would take that envelope that is from fedex and put it somewhere or toss it, or better yet shred it to bits in the shredder. Locking the gate is a good idea. Hopefully your gate is tall enough for them not to get over next time they decide to send you a survey. ?</p>

             <p>Sorry to have to tell you people , I spoke to , was interviewed and had multiple surveys. The guy said we will only have 3 more surveys. Those surveys I answered and were followed by more followup surveys. I was left alone for 1 month before they started calling again. Unlike many people who post here from the start I answered all the questions , it wont stop it just doesnt stop they keep asking the same questions every single time over and over . If Ive answered more than 5 surveys how can I still be threatened with non compliance? My theory is they make 14 dollars an hour in order to collect their pay they have to nag people to get quota. Ive emailed 3 regional directors with my grievance only to be answered by a fourth unknown Regional Director. At this point I welcome the 100 dollar fee or fine if it means they will stop knocking on my door and calling my phone over and over. I will try a reverse Jehovahs Witness technique on them. No Im not interested in the survey but do you want to talk about Jesus for 15 minutes.? Federal employees are not allowed to speak of religion while on duty.</p>

             <p>Since I see this article is getting recent traffic, heres a link to the ACS methodology You want to know when to expect that next mailing, how they handle phone refusal and why that interviewer is so gosh-darn persistent, read the organizations marching orders and know what to expect. It may be out of date, but its hosted on their site and should give you a good idea of how the ACS team operates. So take a look. 3 month cycle w/ 3 phases  Mail, CATI, CAPIIts in there. It even explains things like how if you refuse to answer the first call in the telephone phase youll probably get a second about 2-3 days later from someone with skills in refusal conversion (i.e. theyre persuasive at convincing you to change your mind and answer)theyre following their playbook. Its interesting reading. Know yourselfand know your enemy. I think it will be less frustrating and you can feel far less intimidated as well. But do be polite. ? Its the government after all, so the folks doing the jobs likely dont have the authority or training to exempt you from parts of the processand theyre trained that they really really want your data. </p> 
             <p><a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/survey_methodology/acs_design_methodology_ch07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/survey_methodology/acs_design_methodology_ch07.pdf</a></p> 
             <p>FWIW, Ill get to find out shortly how well they follow procedure since my survey arrived today. Seems about right. The pdf listed above says they mail the initial notice the Thur before the last Monday of the month (20th), and the first survey the last Mon of the month (24th)with mail transit times that seems about right. They would have mailed the reminder postcard today, and if I do nothing I should get the replacement survey somewhere around19-22 Sept. My hunch is that even if you mail a letter they still generally follow this procedure becauseits procedure. Im debating answering the first phone call and asking them to mark my residence as non-interview since thats what theyre gonna get. It doesnt look like it would opt me out of the CAPI (Personal Visit Phase) though *eyeroll* And if the doc is legit then technically you should only have to deal with two FRs (Field Reps aka annoying house stalkers). If you refuse the first they again send an FR trained in refusal conversionmy guess is intimidating notices about penalties and fines and unlawfulness are effective conversion techniques, so dont be intimidatedthey really dont seem to have a leg to stand on.</p> 
             <p>Anyway, well see how this goes =)</p>

               <p>We have had 5 different people come to our home. . .and even though I never answer the door, I know this because each time they leave either their business card (which has their name and phone number on it, which allows us to look them up on the world wide web and youd be surprised what we found out about each of them; for example, one of the folks who came to our home is on our countys democrat partys central committee. . .yeah, like Im really gonna give out my private info to someone with deep political connectionsheck no!) And when they dont leave their business card, they leave a nasty letter with their name and phone number on it and again, they are goofy enough to leave their cell phone numbers which allows us to look them up and find out personal info about them. Would love to use this personal info to turn the tables on them to see how they like having a complete stranger find out info about them (like where they live, how many people in their family/paid for their home/taxes/letters to the editor/city involvement. . .etc. . .and its all free. . .so if we can find out about them, surely they already know everything about us!)</p>

                 <p>Hmm. Well, maybe the doc is out of date or they dont follow it to the letter. Surprising?perhaps not. Right now I just plan to ignore phase 1 (the mailings) and then screen calls to see what messages, if any, they leave on the answering machine. If I answer by accident Im torn on whether to evade confirming my address or just telling them to mark me as refused/non-interview. Either way the attempts at a personal visit are likely unavoidable. If they follow the numbers I *might not* get a visitor, but Ill expect one. Still trying to decide if I just say nothing at all and stare and smile at them if they do find me in person, or tell them 1 person lives here and no threat under the sun will get them any more info, have a nice dayrepeating as required. =P</p>

               <p>Well, its now December, so Ill update so those who care to read others experiences can see my experience as an example =)</p> 
               <p>Aside from my typo above (19-22 OCT, not Sep), everything has been going as expected. I got the second mailer around 19-22 Oct, and then the phone calls started in Nov. I have no caller I.D. and my answering machine is old school, so I dont know when they first called; probably within the first week, but no one left an actual voicemail until mid-month. Im sure they called multiple times, but only 2 voicemail messages and one where it sounded like the folks at the call center were having a chat and didnt realize they dialed me =P</p> 
               <p>Well, I just ignored the messages and Dec 1st I got the first visit to my door in the afternoon. I just didnt answer, and Im not sure how long the guy was there because I didnt hear him at first. But he left a card and a note asking for an appointment. I just removed it after he left. A couple days later I got a voicemail from him saying I could do the survey on the phone and that it was a mandatory thing, but he didnt really sound threatening. He did use my name though, which doesnt surprise me that they can obtain that info.</p> 
               <p>Anyway, I still plan to just ignore it unless he actually catches me coming home from work or something. Im just curious to see if it will be the same guy all month or if theyll try sending someone else, and curious if the language will get stronger the longer I delay. But it doesnt really matter to me at this point. Ill just ignore and see if it goes away at the end of the month when this phase of the process ends.</p>

             <p>I just got off the phone with my mother-in-law. She has received the first of the surveys. I found your site and instantly copied and printed the letter for her. Our entire family (3 households) responded to the 2010 survey with just the legally required information. I can guess that our household will be getting a survey also in the near future.<br> My concern is that my mother-in-law is legally blind and could be taken advantage of by these attack-dog census idiots.<br> If they come to our home they will be politely asked to leave. We will then inform them they are on private property, and might want to remove themselves immediately.<br> We will not be bullied by the government. Not today, not tomorrow.<br> I see some of the posts here and wonder how it is that so many are willing to just hand over anything to the government when they ask?</p>

               <p>Because there are so many in America that are lemming and sheep, Thus our current President and Senate majority!! </p> 
               <p>Having lost many relatives in the Gas chambers, I never understood how so many let themselves be lead to slaughter without a fight! Intelligent Americans need to take up the cry of Israel  Never Again  in a similar fashion to fight the current onslaught against our liberties and rights that are being surrupticiously taken in some cases and overtly in others from us under the guise of our government wanting to help us!!</p> 
               <p>So! I just received my ACS and was wondering what to do with it, -Not soft enough to wipe my ass with it!  when I googled and found this site! I have filled out just resident and 3 people and that is it! I will send in the recommended letter and wait for the onslaught.. I am ready for battle, i am just concerned that my wife and daughter are not for the harassment. </p> 
               <p>I wonder if I put up a sign that says tresspassing census workers will be shot on sight would scare any off?? (LOL) . I wish I had a bigger dog than a dachsund..</p> 
               <p>Anyway, as others have said, I am glad that I am just one of many who feel the same and we need to fight to maintain the America that our forefathers created and defend our constitutional rights against the many that are trying, more and more successfully to take them from us!!!!</p> 
               <p>It is rapidly coming time for American to start thinking about an AMERICAN SPRING (WINTER&lt; SUMMER OR FALL) if we wind up with another 4 years of Progressive rule. France that recently reelected a socialist President, has just proposed a 75% tax on their wealthy.Having lived in France years ago for 13 years, I can tell you 1st hand that the ACS is just a drop in the bucket compared to what may be coming</p>

             <p>I ignored the first mail correspondence. A few weeks later I received a second mail correspondence containing the standard threats. I emailed the contact person, ie local govt schmuck, to request that he email me the questionnaire; I would fill it out and return it electronically. He replied that due to the sensitive nature of the questionnaire, and personal information included, he would be unable to email me the questionnaire. I replied to him that I would not be providing him with any sensitive or personal information, therefore email correspondence is acceptable. A few days later, I get a knock on my door during dinner at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday. He urged me to answer the questions. He would input the information as I answered them, yet I would not be allowed to receive a copy of the information I provided. I respectfully objected. He suggested I call his superior in order to refuse. Again, I ignored the situation. Today I come home to a threatening handwritten note taped on my front door, that I have 48 hours to comply, as the deadline is Sunday evening at 8 pm. I typed into google How to legally refuse the American Census Survey I was pleased to find your site. I am writing the refusal letter now. I have a friend who has a theory: those with Concealed Weapons Permits have been targeted ?? Just a thought. THANKS to all Americans here who care about upholding a FREE AMERICA.</p>

             <p>Okay, I am glad I stumbled on this as I just tried filing out the 2012 census. I stopped and ripped it up as the questions were making me unconfortable. Why do they need to know how many miles it takes me to get to work and how long, or at the specific time I leave each day. And the ammount of hours. I felt like I was being set up. I just almost put in writing when my home would be empty..yeah I will fight this. They do not need to know my schedule. Will be awaiting the phone calls and visitors. Not filling out this info.bring it on.</p>

The law requires us to fill out the Census every 10 years and that i would be happy to do that in 2020 if I am still in this living world. I talked to my attorney who said that the U.S. Census requirement is only every 10 years and that it does not allow other SURVEYS to be issued as a et-al procedure to procure information. He also said that Title 13 is not a law granting information. It merely gives the Census/Commerce Bureau the right to conduct the survey, but in no way is it mandatory as the U.S. Census is. I informed the Census employee of the above, and that i had already done my lawful duty in 2010. She them responded and said that alot of people felt this way and would indicate that I had declined to complete the survey, but that I might recieve other phone calls requesting compleciation of the survey. Sure enough one week later it happened again. Another woman asked if I had completed my survey, and I gave her the name of the first woman who contacted me and my denile. She also said that she would mark down that I declined to complete the survey. Yesterday, about 3 week after the last phone call I got a letter citing the Title 13, and the sections it covers, 141, 193, 221. , and that it required by law. Not! Title 13 and its sections merely give the right for the survey to be given and is not a Constitutional Law that covers the General Census.<br> She also said that if I was worried about any of my personal information getting handed out to anyone other than the Census Bureau that that wouldnt happen. Sure, when elephants fly. Its the government, folks. I also found out that the ones who are gathering this info are a contractor hired by the Census Bureau. How many times have you read in the news about how all of your information has been given out to other business? Its just down to earth intimidation. Havent filled mine out, dont intend to either . I am a VETERAN, LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT AMERICAN, and believe in the 5 faiths given to me by my father. GOD, FAMILY, DUTY, HONOR, COUNTRY. Go get them people.</p>

             <p>Does this information apply to the SQ Class that is mailed to businesses as well? I have received two forms, both of which I received its due attention, meaning it was tossed, and today we receive a call telling us we had to respond and provided us with the info to do so on-line.

             <p>After receiving two ACS surveys, phone calls and a home visit (thankfully I wasnt here), I called the phone number of the census bureau stalker and told her I was not going to comply. She said that I was legally required to, and its like jury dutyyou cant refuse. I said that I had fulfilled my constitutional duty by filling out the 2010 census, and that this survey is intrusive. I asked her to tell her supervisor that I decline to fill it out, and that I know others have declined before. She said no one she knows has ever declined (I live in Minnesotapeople here are pretty compliant!). Well see what happens next! For what its worth, I did not fill out the 2010 survey in its entirety since some of those questions were equally intrusive. I agree with previous posts that the ACS gets sent to the less compliant citizens! Fingers crossed they leave me alone now.</p>

               <p>Theyre back! I got a letter now saying they hope I will reconsider my decision to not participate. The letter also says that in a few days I will be contacted by the field representative again. No way will I fill it out.

             <p>Sadly, my address must be one of the cursed ones. We received this 2 years ago which my husband did fill out as I refused. Weve received both surveys in the mail, and a two weeks ago the phone calls started, getting up to 3 a day every few days. Saturday I counted 3 in 2 hours. We havent answered any of the phone calls. If its a long distance number we dont recognize we dont pick up. Living in the county dont have an address posted and also have a PO box. Would we be better off to answer one of the phone calls and tell them we refuse or just keep ignoring them? Anyone who says just fill it out obviously never has received one.</p>

                 <p>We received our first survey midsummer, and upon reading through the questions decided there was no possible way we were going to respond. Names and birthdates? Exact amount and source of income for the past year? What time we leave for work and the length of our commute? What kind of health insurance we have and who pays for it? REALLY??? I immediately did a search, found this site and was so encouraged by the posts of all of you who are refusing to comply. My husband and I decided that we would not engage with anyone on the phone or in person if we could avoid it. Just as all of you have related, we received our second survey with the sternly worded letter and ignored that, too. The phone calls started a couple of weeks after the deadline we were given. Every day our caller ID showed Census Bureau numbers and other rather mysterious ones. A couple of weeks after the last call, an agent rang our doorbell one evening after dark, but we did not go to the door even though all the lights were on and it was obvious that we were home. The person then banged loudly on the door for a while and then left. That was two weeks ago and weve heard nothing since. Im under no illusion that the quiet will last. This survey is clear evidence of an over-reaching government. How ludicrous for these people to threaten us with fines and jail so that they can help us. Anyone who believes the stated reasons for this survey is beyond gullible. I know there is a concerted effort afoot to penalize people living in suburban areas who drive some distance to work, so that explains some of the questions. The reason for asking about health insurance should be patently obvious to anyone. If we continue to allow this kind of intrusion on our privacy, we will eventually get exactly the government we deserve. Even a member of my family who is a self-described liberal agrees that this survey is outrageous. One of the most annoying aspects of this is the fact that our tax dollars are being used to hire people to harrass us. God bless you, Kevin, for your research and for sharing with those of us searching for the truth. And kudos to all of you who have decided to draw the line by refusing to comply with this abomination of a survey. I am joining your number.</p>

               <p>Kelly,</p> 
               <p>I found the magic word to stop the phone calls  harrassment. I told the second caller that I had already advised them that I am refusing to complete the survey and that she was harassing mehavent received any phone calls since. Unfortunately the letters are still coming and I have had two visits by a census field rep, the first visit I wasnt home and I didnt answer the door for the second visit because I didnt recognize the person at the door (and suspiciously there was no car in the area). Not sure how to stop the visits yet, but Im thinking of advising them that they are trespassing on private property, harassing me and invading my privacy  will see if that works! Good luck and hang in there!</p>

             <p>Just got a second survey. For 3 weeks now EVERY DAY have received phone calls from them, we just ignore them. It is getting on my wifes nerves. She feels harrassed, and wants to fill it out just so the phone calls will stop. Waiting for them to show up at our house. This is just not right. We should not be afraid of our goverment. I work some night shifts, if they show up I will ask them what they would do if someone knocked on their door at 3AM, and then tell them NOW is MY 3AM.<br> Hope it does not come to this.</p>

             <p>My fresh hell is Current population survery being conducted for Labor Dept for employment stats. Recived notice in mail on a Monday last month was chosen out of 9,0000 households. similiar to ACS but not as detailed. The first door pounding leaning on door bell visit came the very next day and has gone on for a month. The notice stated no form, all interviews were entered on laptop and it will happen 4 x this year and 4 x next year. I fing refuse to even acknowlege these people exist and kept throwing all the notices they left outside on the ground. The last stalker who drives a black car with FLAMES on the hood and side, looks like cooking meth is their full time job , and has out of state plates actually picked them up. We have a 6 ft privacy fence around the property and they have tried the side and back gates to gain entrace to the back door. They talked to my neighbors who were smart enough to tell them we are never around. The last letter from them addressed to Occupant and started with Dear Friend stated today was the last day they would be in my hood but I could call for a phone inteview. I want to reply Dear Stranger stop insulting my intelligence, you know exactly who I am. It was a waste of money sending your CB SWAT team to pound on my door, attempt to scale my fence and stop by at 850p for a chat about my job, salary, benefits and other identity theft questions. Of course they got my phone number but I have caller ID, no answering machine &amp; never pickup unless I know the number just like I would never answer the door to strangers.</p>

               <p>Of course they are back and it started Nov 11  a FEDERAL holiday with a note taped to the front door &amp; garage door to call to set up an appointment. I left it them up, saw her park in the alley today, get out and then get back in when she saw the note stil taped to the garage door.<br> Will see is she shows up on Thanksgiving.

             <p>So I got the survey this summer (2012), found this website, filled out just the number of occupants and hand wrote the letter because my printer wasnt working. Ive so far gotten 3 phone calls that Ive never answered and let the machine pick them up, the last one happened today (sunday) just as we got back from church (10-12). So what should I do next? any ideas?</p>

               <p>Scott, from what I can gather from all the postings here, it really doesnt matter how you respond. Even people who have filled out the survey in its entirety and returned it have been subjected to further phone calls and personal visits by CB representatives. My choice is to ignore phone calls and visits  weve had two more personal visits and just did not answer the door. I simply dont feel like explaining to a clueless person the reasons I choose not to comply. The bottom line is they have no constitutional right to force our compliance. Good luck with whatever course you decide to take!</p>

             <p>I too have been called several times, and I have told them that I refuse to answer this unconstitutional survey. They call my wife and were trying to intimidate her over the phone, she told them the same thing.</p> 
             <p>Just today someone came to my door and tried to tell me this was required by the constitution. Of course it isnt, I informed her of that, gave her the above letter (seemed pretty good), and informed her that I believe they are trespassing and if they appear again on my property I would contact the local police department to have them removed.</p> 
             <p>She wasnt happy but I can say at least another government employee that is uneducated or worse lying to the American public and getting very FAT and happy on her government pay check.</p>

Told them (again) that they couldnt confirm legitimately who they were, that I was not going to answer their questions because of it, that they didnt have the authority to obtain the required information from me (was told by the caller they did have constitutional authority to do so), was then told I was going to be marked as refused and when I said Id send in the form with a letter explaining my position, was told, youll love this oneIts too late to send it in and theyll mark me refused anyway.</p>

             <p>I received my 2 surveys, 2 letters and 2 calls so far. 1st call was message, 2nd I actually answered played dumb like I had no clue what they where talking about. they wanted to know if my phone number was the address they sent the surveys to. I replied, I refuse to give any information to people I dont know over the phone.</p> 
             <p>When you disect the ACS ALL the information is with the local, county, state government. Why does the Federal government need to take a community survey when the community is more than capable of taking a survey for their exact needs. </p> 
             <p>The state DOT counts traffic as needed, so why do I need to tell them when I leave for work and how many miles I drive? if roads and traffic are an issue, the local governments would address the issue.</p> 
             <p>Why does the Census need my income doesnt the IRS and SS already have that info? along with the State?</p> 
             <p>Why does the Feds need to know my property tax? the county has it on file. What would the Census use my property tax information for? they can just get all the property tax info for every property online.</p>

             <p>We received two surveys in the mail and I agree with others who stated we only received this because we refused to answer all the questions on the initial census. We have now also been contacted by phone three times, the most recent left a message asking us to call the 800 number. He gave us a file number to identify our case. I deleted the message but we are now so tired and frankly quite terrified of what will happen if we dont answer the survey that we are now taking the two hours or so to fill it out. My husband works in a job that could be jeopardized if there were to be an investigation. Im not sleeping at night worrying about the knock on the door. I can not believe our government has resorted to threats and intimidation, but it is happening. Whats next?</p>

               <p>Lisa, Look at all the past 644 blogs. Nothing happened to anyone. We havent heard a word since our 4th visit last June. They put fear in you. If unsure you can always hold onto the survey for down the road as I did for a while. There is no deadline on filling it out. You can say you just never got around to finishing it if push comes shove. Dont think you will ever need it.When we were paid visits it almost got to be like a game. To bad so sad, missed you again. Did have Haydens template letter taped outside our door. Nice conversation piece with neighbors.<br> By now there are enough frustrated people.maybe it is time for a rally in D.C.<br> Write or call your representatives. Dont give up.</p>

                 <p>Look folks  they have no legal standing to make you answer their completely voluntary survey. The legal citations they use are in error. The people hounding you are mostly poorly paid minimum wage workers who are probably paid a small bonus for every unresponsive person they can coerce to finally provide the information they are requesting. No one has ever been prosecuted for not responding. As a matter of fact, they initially always stated in their brochures that the survey was voluntary, until they determined that they could get more people to respond if they worded the survey envelopes and materials in such a way to make people think it was a crime not to respond. Look folks, these people who come to your house are like the old encyclopedia salesmen  they refuse to take No for an answer. A lot of BS but no teeth.</p>

               <p>Recently my family was the victim of a Terrorist Attack. I am going to name the group so others can be on the lookout as well. It appears to be a harmless survey called the American Community Survey, it comes from the US Census Bureau.<br> We received the first survey some months ago, then we recieved another one, assuming they were junk mail and they were I promptly round filed the second one so it could join the first one in the land fill. We then receivd a phone call where right after his introduction the gentleman launched into asking me questions, I told him since I did not know who he was I could not answer any questions, he said ok we will send you a letter. it arrived and you guessed it i round filed it. I then recieved a call from some lady who told me she was with the American Community Survey, I stopped and told her i was on the national do not call list, as such i dont do phone interviews, surveys, telemarketing, or sales over the phone and to remove me from the list. She said she was with the goverment and they dont remove people from their list. I told her guess i would just have to disconnect it, she told me to do what I needed to do.<br> Their next tactic was to ambush my wife, she came home from work to find a white suburban parked out front and the lady approched her and tried to get her to answer the survey. She refused and went inside.<br> THis evening up on my arrival home I found a fedex mailer shoved under my front door, I opened it. insdie was a letter threatening me with penalties for not complying with their request. I promptly called the lady listed on the survey(same one who had left cards for me to call her and visited my wife). I told her to remove me from thier list, i was not going to tell her anymore than 2 people live here, both are employed, both are between the age of 18 and 65, both drive cars, SUVs to be exact, gas guzzlers if she must know. I aksed her why the need to know if we have indoor toliets, a stove, or refrigerator? how far and what time we leave for work is our business. She said she needed my name and address to mark me complete. I said hell you been to my house you must have the address. I pointed out to her that 23 million Americans need a job, they should be working on that and not some damm survey. She said, she could not take me off the list since i had not given her my name and or address. I told her the sidewalk is where public property ends, dont come on mine again. </p> 
               <p>So if a survey lady hollers at you from the sidewalk you can thank me for keeping them off your doorstep.</p>

                 <p>I am also getting stalked by an ACS rep who has come to me house 6-7 times in Phoenix AZ. The letter on Interstate Commerce Commission vs. Brimson was taped to my garage door which the rep took with him on the last visit. The next thing I know a second Fedex letter comes saying they acknowledge us not wanting to participate but cite title 13 US code, and a rep will be coming by again to obtain the info. I already said how many people reside at this residence in the letter, but they want blood! What is the best way to stop this harassment without answering any more of their invasive questions?</p>

                   <p>Thank you to everyone whos posted on this site. Im very happy to have found it. After the phone calls had stopped for a few weeks, I thought we were in the clear. But we had our first unwelcome visit a couple of days ago. We saw the woman coming and didnt answer the door. As far as I can tell, she didnt know we were home. She knocked on both the front and back doors, then left her card and a fairly polite letter. We have not spoken or responded to these people in any way. We did not send back the survey or answer any of the calls. Has anyone had them simply go away without having to confront them? I wonder if were never home (as far as they know) if theyll eventually give up. Also, does anyone know how to find out the trespassing laws in Illinois?</p>

             <p>Amen, Brian. I am a veteran as well, and have a son currently serving in the U.S.A.F. I am absolutely appalled and disgusted that we are now being harassed by the very government of the country we voluntarily served to defend with our lives.<br> I received the first ACS mailing in the end of Sept. and initially didnt know what it was. I started to fill it out, but as I got further into it I said to myself, youve got to be kidding me! Into the shredder it went. The next day I googled ACS and thankfully found this site.<br> I received the second survey a few weeks later, and I use it to educate my friends, co-workers, and neighbors as to what Big Brother is up to. Most have never heard of the ACS, and when they see the intrusive, personal information the government is requesting, they are shocked to say the least.<br> So now the phone calls have started. One call last Monday (they left a message with a case number), three calls yesterday, and so far one this evening. Thank God for caller ID. I am so utterly pissed that I wont answer the phone. They may have tried calling last week, but we were 11 days without power due to hurricane Sandy, and Im still a little cranky so I figure its probably best I dont answer.<br> I have to say I am so disappointed in this government of the country I love and served, and my son is currently defending, that I cant even put it into words. What has happened to the U.S.A. (never mind, I already know) that we citizens can no longer be guaranteed peace and privacy in our own homes?<br> In any event, I really appreciate everyones input on this site. Bless you all who have stood up to this un-constitutional invasion of privacy by an increasingly over reaching government.<br> With the information I was able to find here, I now have my NO TRESPASSING sign posted, I printed out my letter of refusal, my state and local trespass statutes, and have a copy of the constitution standing by for when the Census Drones come knocking, which apparently is only a matter of time.<br> When he or she does come, I intend to not answer the door. But if push comes to shove and I must talk to them, they will be only be told that three people live here, and will be presented with my letter of refusal.<br> On second thought, I will show them one more thing: It will be my DD-214 (discharge from active duty) form, and I will ask them which branch of the United States Military THEY served in. Then I will proceed to politely but firmly tell them I have already given the government more than enough information, and 6 years of my life in defense of this nation. I will then wish them good day and shut the door.</p>

             <p>Here is the backwords rationale for the ACS: The Feds use our tax dollars as bribe money to circumvent the 10th amendment. They need the data from the ACS to determine how big your bribe should be for complying with their unconstitutional federal rules on things like highway speed limits and education standards. Its also a great jobs programs for people in the DC area  all of the phone calls and number crunching requires a lot bureaucrats!</p>

             <p>I received my first harrassment letter today. It follows two surveys; first one tossed as I believed it was a scam by some marketer. The second one I sent to Call Curtis on TV who said it was not a scam. Then the person came to the door and left a number to call. Then the phone call. Today got the official letter from James T. Christy, Regional Director. I take heart in that no one has actually been fined. I wrote to my Congresswoman, Dianne Feinstein to stop the harrassment but have had no reply. What has happened to our privacy rights. Is this how we create new jobs?</p>

             <p>It started with us about two months ago. Letters first, then phone calls, then five knocks on the door. We ignored all of it. </p> 
             <p>After the first phone call, we changed the phone greeting to a generic one that does not identify us or our number (we were prepared to change our phone number but didnt have to), we unplugged the phone at night, kept curtains closed on first floor, put out guard dog on duty signs, posted two NO TRESPASSING signs and even locked the gate onto the deck.</p>

             <p>So I just received my survey a couple days ago and in the process of researching this came across this site and have read all of your posts. One thing I am noticing that I have not seen anyone mention is this is not the year for decade or mid decade as the law or statute they created mentions. So how do they justify that? </p> 
             <p>The thing that bothers me most is how many cars? When do they leave? The address of where you work? And how long does it take you to get home? Sound like questions to give someone access to go into my home to search or seize things. I know this sounds really preposterous and if you knew me and that I am no one of any interest to anyone in the government for any reason you would tell me if that is what is bothering me go on and fill it out. However, I am like the rest of you this seems so contrary to what we believe in and our freedom and if I were to happen to be someone of interest why would I not be concerned about this line of questioning.</p> 
             <p>My spouse is not as much a rebel as myself and has told me to do with it as I wish but if it ends up causing calls and visits it will really make him angry at me for standing for this principle so I am not sure what I will do.</p>

             <p>i love how people try to make this a partisan issue. </p> 
             <p>this is a FASCIST issue. and fascism has been in the uSSA/ameriKa since 9/11 occurred. </p> 
             <p>it is only recently that some of you are awakening to it. im not even sure how i ended up on this site. i was looking for info about living off the grid and tiny houses and here i am. </p> 
             <p>we need to UNIFY as PEOPLE and let the differences go. that is what the POWER ELITE, the CENTRAL BANK and the cronies (read: folly-ticians) want. </p> 
             <p>they are winning. </p> 
             <p>if you do not know of what i am speaking, please educate yourself about fascism  look up Lawrence Britt and the 14 Points of Fascism. remember- this is NOT a xitan country. you do NOT want a xtian country. remember nazi germany  a xtian country. the arabian states  muslim countries. et cetera. there is much more. i will not go on.</p>

             <p>What I think everyone is missing is that these letters are not addressed to anyone. They are addressed to resident. How can anyone be legalaly fined or prosecuted when resident is not a legal description of anyone in my home. I told them I toss everything that is addressed to resident and she asked me what name it needed to be sent to. I said that if you dont know that then I will not give it to you. She then said that a letter of refusal would be sent to my address and I told her that it would go in the trash if it was sent to resident and she once again asked for my name. For the stated use of this survey it is of no use as with todays modern demographic studies, this info is readily available and more accurate than what the Feds can provide.</p>

             <p>I got a visit today (havent got any calls, probably because I do Oomaone more reason to do Ooma instead of phone, and with Ooma I can block them if they get the number anyway). She said it is required and I asked how much the fine was. Interestingly, she begged off and said that was not her department Makes me think maybe the fine only is $100. She tried to give me an envelope with more information but I wouldnt take it and told her I would think about it.</p>

             <p>I received the call today where all articles were cited to me when I told the lady that i refuse to answer the form. She got more persuasive. I told her, if this was a census form I have no objection on telling them how many family members i have in the house but will not provide them any more information. She is going to send me the refusal letter. I dont intend to answer any more that members is house. I feel like I am living in a communist country where govt needs to know how many times you go to bath room. We need to stand up for our rights !</p>

             <p>first it was the letter, then the lady at door she was VERY persistant and VERY pushy.. tried making her way into my home several times and each time I let her know she was not welcomed, I was busy, etc.. I received the fed-ex letter in the mail, more notes on the door and tonight after many weeks of avoiding her, my child answered to door while I was cooking and guess who was their the dreaded survey lady again.. she literally walked into my home, into my kitchen without asking, I told her I was busy and cooking dinner.. she continued to my kitchen and said oh, continue cooking, I wont take long. now she has left after doing this intruding survey, and said oh, I have to come back or call in a week for a few more questions, can I have your phone number? I said no, and she said she would leave hers at the door if I did not answer and to call her asap to complete second part of survey. This is absolutely REDICULOUS. I HAVE RIGHTS TO DENY,WHICH I DID MANY MANY TIMES.

               <p>I had this trouble in 2011. It sounds like things have changed a little in that they are now sending a letter of refusal. I had about 3 or 4 calls, then found this site and returned the template letter with the empty survey. After that I got another call and told the woman that I returned the survey on xxxx date. She said they hadnt received it. I told her that wasnt my problem, that she should call the office in the city where the return address was and have them track it down. Never heard from them again, no calls, no visits, no letter of refusal. </p> 
               <p>I had emailed both senators and representative. One actually had their legal assistant call me and we had a great half-hour chat. I quoted her the legal case mentioned in the template letter and she asked me if I was a lawyer. Told her no, just go research it, that the fines and jail sentence the Census Bureau is trying to scare everyone with actually pertains to being legally subpoenad by name to appear in court or to provide documents to the court. If the subpoenad person refuses, he can then be fined and/or sent to jail. I told her that the Census Bureau is NOT the court and that the ACS isnt a subpoena, and that it wasnt addressed to me. She said she would research the language on the ACS form to see if it was mis-represented as a subpoena. That was late 2011 or early 2012. Havent heard anything else. Now I see here that people are getting the letter of refusal. Sorry if my discussion with a senatorial aide caused this!</p>

                 <p>I have heard of that.. using a court order or sub-poena as a way to get someone to do something, such as pay a credit card debt, because you cant throw someone in jail for that specifically. </p> 
                 <p>Personally I would refuse giving the court anything either.. nor would I pay any fine. Ill take the contempt.. I have one already and as I told him, it wont be my last. </p>

             <p>Thank you for this post. We just received our first letter taped to our front door yesterday for the American Community Survey. As an attorney, I immediately looked up the referenced federal laws they cite to claim we are required to respond to the survey. I totally agree with your reading of Section 193  what questions would need to be asked in preparation for a head count? I called the field office today (Philadelphia) and spoke with a lovely woman who, after assuring me the survey and listed field representative were legitimate (which I wasnt questioning to begin with), also assured me that I was legally required to answer the survey. When I asked her to tell me exactly what law requires me to do so, she of course could not answer and kicked the ball to the field representative  he would know. I am going to return the survey with the above cover letter. This is going to be fun.</p>

               <p>We are in the same position. Have received two surveys, two letter, 3 calls and a late night visit. We of course do not want to fill it out. I found another couple of websites that had these same outraged (from 2008, and 2101) comments, but i can never find any follow up. Do you or anyone, reading these comment, know of any stats of people that have been fined? imprisoned? I dont find it fun, just annoying and intrusive.</p>

                 <p>I recd a survey many years back and filled it out- didnt know any better. Then, the next survey year, I got a survey again but refused to fill it out. A field rep came and I told her I refused to fill it out again, get someone else. Several phone calls started which included a supervisor as the last and final call. I just stood my ground and refused. After talking to him, it all just stopped. No fine or imprisonment. Now here I am again with this damn survey. I through both in the garbage. Received a postcard reminder and letters. Phone calls have been coming for about 3 weeks now. I only answered twice.first one stating the owner was not home and she no longer lives here and I was just here watering the plants. The second time I answered was earlier today, telling them the owner was not here and I was too busy to talk to whoever this is and hung up. They called back this evening, but God Bless caller ID I didnt answer and I wont anymore. If they show up to my home I will not answer and if they catch me outside, I will maintain that I am only there to water plants and check on the property because the owner has left the country.</p>

             <p>Have thrown away 3, and they have been to my house 3 times. I was told the last time she came that I could just fill it out annoyomous and I said I was busy. She made a appointment to come back and when she came back I told her to just give me the form to fill out and I would fill it out annoyomously and mail back , She then tried to come in my house and I told her no and to send me another and she said she couldnt. What a bunch of crap. Anyway, supposedly she is sending her supervisor next. I am taping that letter to my door and with the number of people in my household!</p>

I actually called the regional office listed on the letters after hours. Did you know the Census folks, which are there just to count heads, have about 8 surveys in place ranging from construction to health surveys? 800-992-3530, call for yourself to find out. I am actually going to call them tomorrow and request a supervisor come out so I can try and put this to bed once and for all. And no, they will get no answers other than 2, the number of people that live here. I had fun with this at the start such as thanking them for sending the survey as it helped me build a fire to keep warm on a cold night, or that I threw them in the trash. They didnt like either answer. Walk on my property without a warrant and you go to the ground and arrested as a trespasser.</p>

             <p>Update!!<br> Well, I endured the persistent telephone calls (never answered a single one), and tonight, right before dinner, my doorbell rings. My wife thought it was the UPS guy, but much to her surprise, she opens the door and sees this disheveled looking man who could barely speak English, muttering he is from the Census Bureau. I was in my living room on the phone, but my dog, who is a really mellow hound went nuts! My wife had to grab her by the collar, and shes barking like mad and trying to get to this guy. (We should have let her out!)<br> My wife said I cant talk right now, while holding back my very agitated dog and shut the door. So what does this genius do? He sits on the rocking chair on my porch! He sauntered by the No Trespassing sign, and then he makes himself comfy on my porch!<br> I peeked out the window, to get a look at him and his vehicle (an old beat up junker) and I said to my wife youve got to be kidding me! This guy looks like a stalker. This is what they send out to peoples homes?<br> After a few minutes, he stuffed something in my door and went back to his car. By this time, I found my refusal letter, and copies of the state and local trespass statutes, and a copy of the HIPPA law, which he was going to be handed if he came back. He didnt. After a short time, he drove off.<br> I retrieved what he left in my door, and this is the absolute best part. It was his business card, and a crinkled up dirty piece of paper, that I cant understand because it was all written in SPANISH!!! He wrote on the top that it was his second attempt to contact us. (Dont know when the first was, as no one ever left anything at my home before)<br> His business card indicates he is out of the NYC office. I hope he like spending time in his beat up old clunker, cause I live 1 and 1/2 hours from there with no traffic, which is pretty much never.<br> It amazes me that our government would send a creepy looking guy, in a creepy looking car, who can barely speak English all this way to leave a letter in a language I do not speak. That is the problem with our country today. The lunatics are running the asylum.<br> I cant wait until the hobo shows up again, and I get to serve him with MY paperwork and tell him to scram. Maybe I need a Spanish No Trespassing sign</p>

               <p>The guy that came to our house several times was extremely creepy looking. He wore a womans floppy hat and drove an old beat up 1970s Datsun. He would stand on the porch or sit in his car in front of the house for up to half an hour at a time. He knocked on all the neighbors doors too and they couldnt believe the census bureau would send out someone so creepy.</p>

             <p>Thanks so much for the research and the letter. I have now officially responded. They know 3 people live here and thats it. I dont intend to have my rights violated any more than they already have been. I had one of the minions actually call me the other day. I told her not to interrupt me and I was going to read her my response. I simply read the letter and told her I would be mailing it in. She couldnt get off the phone fast enough with me. I think she thought I was an attorney and she was afraid. I mean seriously these forms are being mailed to Jefferson , IN not Washington DC. They like to sound so official,, in power and important and they dont like being hit with facts. </p>

             <p>Will your response or declination to respond also work for the department of commerce census? This is different than the American census form and asks a lot of questions about my business. My concern is that my corporation is not an individual so it may not be protected? The 2012 dept of commerce census is another intrusive form I would like to avoid responding as I do not consider the government to be looking out for anyones interests other their own. -Edward</p>

             <p>I received 2 pieces of mail from the ACT. 1) A letter stating a survey would be coming and 2) an letter with a bar code that told me it was the law to comply with the survey via a government internet site. </p> 
             <p>I checked out the site, but in the ID code  and I bombarded with the most intrusive questions about me and my family members. I was going to fill it with obnoxious answers, (1,000 people lived in my house; I live on Mars; Use my Transporter Room from Star Trek to get to work).</p> 
             <p>I decided against that  thinking that they were going to use it against me.</p> 
             <p>So  I am NOT going to comply. Period. I agree that the purpose of the Census is for taxation and representation purposes  PERIOD.</p> 
             <p>I will tell them ONLY what the Constitution needs: How many people live in the house. Done.</p> 
             <p>An FBI AGENT cannot ask the probing, intrusive questions in the survey without placing you UNDER ARREST and READING YOUR RIGHTS. Even after all that you have a CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO SAY NOTHING.</p> 
             <p>Therefore, no obnoxious answers  no exaggerations  you can the number of people in the house. No names, no numbers, no bank accounts, no number of toilets in my house. Let me close with a line from the 1960s iconic TV show The Prisoner:</p> 
             <p>I will not make any deals with you. Ive resigned. I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed or numbered. My life is my own. I resign.</p>

             <p>Yeah, we had the standard treatment of mail. So I checked out the legality of this breach of the 4th amendment right. After which I maintain that it is indeed a huge breach to our rights. If the current administration has already done away with the Bill of Rights that every soldier has believed he is fighting for when he puts his life on the line, let the administration say so publicly. Until then, my answer is NO! </p> 
             <p>The agent as they are referred to trespassed around our gate onto the neighbors property which was also posted, and proceeded up our long driveway. Upon reaching our house she met my wife. My wife asked her how she got onto our property. She plainly stated that she trespassed onto the neighbors land to get to ours. She was then told to leave, because she was trespassing. She refused and continued to pursue. My wife called the Sheriff and the agent turned back to the way she came. She stopped her pursuit like a rat when the light was turned on. If she actually had any authority she should have stuck around rather than cower to the authority established by We the People. </p> 
             <p>It is important to note that this agent had her laptop open and moved it from side to side as one would do if they were filming and photographing. The damage has been done. A picture tells a 1000 words. She has stolen what was not rightfully hers to take. This is beyond the breach of privacy provided by those who have bled and died for our freedom. </p> 
             <p>This agents name is Irma Erenberger. She lives in Albany, OR. Her address is listed in the phone book.</p>

               <p>Bob, I cant help wondering how much these census agents are being paid per survey for the number of surveys they turn in. Thats got to be the reason they are so incredibly agressiveI cant believe anyone would be that passionate about having to harrass people. The lady that contacted me on the phone was outrageous. Maybe these people are out of work, former collection agency people. Its horrible. The other thing that amazes me is their total lack of reasoning ability  there is just no reasoning with them. I have to admit that this whole situation is frightening..the invasion of privacy and willingness of fellow citizens to act like thugs just to do a government survey !!! Sounds like Germany or Hungary .not America.</p>

             <p>I too, like many people have had the unfortunate experience of being randomly selected to divulge all of my personal information or be subject to fines, etc, etc.</p> 
             <p>My experience started a few months ago with the letter, the packets, and then finally, visits to my door. The first two times a census worker came to my door, I was not at my house or I was on the phone.</p> 
             <p>I was on the telephone conducting business for my Job and the census employee rang the doorbell several times over a period of 5 minutes and then left a card at the door. </p> 
             <p>Knowing ahead of time the extent of the questions, due to a number of legal reasons I have always decided to refuse to participate.</p> 
             <p>The employee came the very next day on a Saturday, walked up my driveway and asked me if I had received any of the surveys or his attempts to contact me. I immediately instructed him that I was refusing the survey, and asked him to leave. He tried to explain to me that it wasnt a bad survey, it would be quick, etc, etc, and then walked into the mouth of my garage. I instructed him 2 more times that I refused, and told him he was trespassing on private property and asked him to leave.</p> 
             <p>It was at that point he showed me his plastic ID badge again, and told me he had a legal right to be there. At that point, I asked him one more time to leave and said I was calling the police. He literally stood there until the dispatch lady came on and I said, Hello, I have a government census worker, Mr. X, who refuses to leave, etc. as soon as he heard that, he was in his car immediately.</p> 
             <p>My question is this, why do these guys use these tactics. If I say no, GET OFF MY PROPERTY.</p>

               <p>The information given on the ACS form is important not only for the Community but since Katrina, State and local governments use it also in disaster situations. When answering the questions you are not required to give your names, you can be Person 1, Person 2, etc. If there is a question you do not want to answer you simply say I dont know or I dont care to answer that. The U.S. Census is a data collection service of the U.S. government only and is in no way connected or associated with any other branch of the government. Your information is protected from sharing any Personal Identifiable information. There is absolutely no need to act like an attorney and write long letters or threaten to throw people off your property. The Census IS required by law but the amount of information you give beyond the basics is up to you. You are however helping yourself and your neighborhood by participating. Target, Lowes,Starbucks all use Census data when deciding store locations.</p>

                 <p>There are situations that people like you seem to have become complacent or totally ignorant about. This is the United States of America, a democratic Republic. We live here because it is the freest country in the world, because We the People govern ourselves, and we have a Constitution that tells our elected officials what they can do and not the other way around. The more we allow them to do to us, the more they will do to us. It is obvious that this is a case of some bureaucrat, probably under orders from a politician to wheedle all the personal information they can from the totally ignorant rabble of the country, so that they can oppress us even further. I personally enjoy my liberty, I have fought for it, not just for me but for all of our people, I have no intentions of lying down so they can screw me.</p>

                 <p>The information is used primarily by private marketing and retail groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (not a government entity, but essentially a lobbying organization). In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the single largest lobbying organization in the World, spending at $1,304,320,680 since 1998. The spent $79,205,000 in 2016 alone. </p>

             <p>I received this in the mail today. I contacted my Senators and Representative. I asked them why I received this and why the government needs this info. This is an invasion of privacy at best and info for fema camps at worst. It goes against Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution and the 4th ammendment. They (sen. and rep.) both hung up on me. Hung up on me? But not before telling me it was a felony not to fill it out. Only one gave me his first name and when I asked about his last he said it was private. Private? Public servant, private? It doesnt even sound right. I am retired from the military. I am 100% disabled. I have given my best years of my life to serving this country. I am a prior Border Patrol Agent and a police officer of two states. I have seen this country on a continuous downward spiral. Do not let parites get in the way of this; for they are one in the same. Kevin Hayden is absolutely 100% correct in the laws. The absolute authority of the land is the Constitution. I just received my bullying packet from the government yesterday. I was unsure of what to do with it. I had contacted one of my friends who is a Federal Agent in a different field than I was. He stated he filed it in box 13 (the trash). I was searching the internet and came across this webpage. I thank the Lord for it. I was starting to believe there were no more patriots left in this country. I found out I was wrong. I will go through this little ordeal till the end. I am not afraid of the government. I have spent my entire life working for them and I know what they are capable of doing. I just want to leave with one thing: That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, then to write themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. -Declaration of Independence 1776. Folks, we did not get into this predicament overnight and we will not get out of it in one day. We have a long ride ahead of us. So please stay on the train, buckle up and enjoy the ride.</p>

             <p>I received the American Community Survey mailed survey today. After reading the invasive questions and the threats, it is my opinion that my rights under the constitution allow me to decline answering this survey. I returned the unanswered survey, a copy of the Rutherford Institute letter, and this letter to the Director of the Census :</p> 
             <p>My name and address</p> 
             <p>Jan 15, 2013</p> 
             <p>Director<br> US Census Bureau<br> PO Box 5240<br> Jefferson, IN 47199-5240</p> 
             <p>RE: American Community Survey</p> 
             <p>As an American citizen of the United States of America,I am protected by our Constitution. In my opinion, I cannot be compelled to supply the Census Bureau with the private information the American Community Survey asks me to provide. I site the the Fourth Amendment which guarantees my right to be secure .</p> 
             <p>The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</p> 
             <p>In addition, I have included a letter from John W. Whitehead, Founder and President of the Rutherford Institute to Robert M. Groves, Director, US Census Bureau date March 21, 2012 which further explains my position. Any further attempt to obtain this private information from either my spouse or me by any means including mail, telephone, or personal visit will be considered harassment and/or trespassing.</p> 
             <p>Respectfully,</p> 
             <p>My name and address</p> 
             <p>I believe this survey is an extreme government overreach. I encourage all citizens to exercise their constitutional rights in a lawful manner by refusing to submit this clearly protected private information.</p>

             <p>Today was my big show down with the CB.I knew today was coming I just didnt know when.I have recieved 2 forms to fill out that went to recycle bin.Lord only knows how my calls that start in Nov.2012 (25 t0 30).At least 8 to 10 threatening letters.Monday we recieved our first visit from CB agent with letter taped to front and back door.My little girl answered the phone this afternoon around 3:30 thinking it was her mother coming home from work.It was CB agent and so I told her to hang up.I knew without a doubt the agent was racing to our house, now that my daughter had confirmed someone was home.People I live in the middle of a 70 acre farm just me and my family and there is a reason for that.WE LIKE OUR PRIVACY!!! I get in my truck with a arm load of guns and drive to end of driveway and pull my truck across it to block the entrance.Where Iam from we hold theCONSTITUTION dear to our hearts.Today I was at the end of my patience,I can ignore the calls and trash the letters but there is no where else to go when you come to my house(Dad told me 30 years ago when I moved out of his house that he enjoyed our time together but dont come back).Well sure enough about 20 minutes later a car with a very nice looking CB agent(which didnt do her a damn bit of good) pulled up and stopped.I met her at her door and she went into her little speech about she was only doing her job and if I would just listen ENOUGH.Today was my day, I told her if she ever came on my property again ,1 of us was going to jail the other to hell ,and truly meant every word of it.Thomas Jefferson ounce said When goverments fear the people we have democracy,but when the people fear the goverment we have tyranny.I hope today was the end of this story, but in my heart I know it isnt.Tomorrow they will try to take my guns.The next day my beliefs in God and so on until they have all I own.Then they will give me what they want me to have.People today I made my stand and will give up my very last breath,last drop of blood so my children and there children will enjoy the freedoms that I have had in my life.The question is when will you make your stand.</p>

             <p>I just wanted to stop by and say thank you for the time and effort that went to writing this article. I skipped on over some parts as I do not have much time at the moment, but I have been constantly harassed by the Census Bureau for refusing to answer questions pertaining to the Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey for 2012/2013. I have been contacted repeatedly by a field representative, the regional direction, and lately two other census representatives. The most recent one left a very lengthy voice-mail which was quite Ill-mannered to say the least. </p> 
             <p>I have this voice-mail saved on my phone from 1/18/2013:</p> 
             <p>Hello this is your ah us Census lady, I just knocked on your door and was wondering why you were not answering, I can hear noises inside and I can see your bubble wrap all over the window and can shadows and your lights are on so why arent you answering the door? I know that you live with your boyfriend as well, we just need some information from you to fill out the US Census form, you can call me back at 1 800 kiss my ass dot com, US Census lady out.</p> 
             <p>Honestly, at this point Id like to take legal action if its even possible, but I will definitely send the letter above along with the recording of this voice-mail to the Regional Director and see how that goes.</p>

             <p>I received the letter in todays mail informing me that in a few days I will receive the ACS. </p> 
             <p>Im Deaf and work from home. I know that Ill be dealing with someone coming to my door because I plan to send the above templated letter in response to the ACS that arrives in the mail. So I assume I will be visited at some point and more than once. I also have several dogs on the property as I am a volunteer rescuer. </p> 
             <p>Any tips on how to handle this from a Deaf perspective? I lip read and can speak, but its easy to get overwhelmed when one can not understand the person speaking to them. </p> 
             <p>Ive read all the great replies here and am thankful for the information provided here. Most of my friends and family think Im being silly to refuse to respond.</p>

               <p>Naia, the fact you are deaf should not put you at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the government.</p> 
               <p>If you cannot understand the demands made of you by a government representative/agent due to a recognized disability/limitation, that is not your fault.I would simply shrug, indicate with hand signs that you are deaf and close the door. Alternatively, ignore any knocks or doorbells because you cant hear it anyway (wink wink).</p>

               <p>If they REALLY wanted to talk to you then theyd send someone out that is a professional to work with the Deaf depending on your main form of communication. If they send out the wrong type of person to work with you too bad and all the better. Id refuse to write as well because while it is your written language it does get tiring. Im an ASL interpreter student and we had to use that form to communicate for 15 minutes and that was exhausting especially seeing our teachers were Deaf and no talking was allowed.</p>

             <p>received notice today that our household was randomly selected to receive the survey. i DREAD having to deal with this. i dont feel comfortable giving this information to anyone, let alone the incompetent federal govt. would someone please outline specifically what steps i should take in dealing with this? first do i fill out only the acceptable information then return with the letter? what next? should i contact my congresspeople? are there certain responses i should give via phone/in-person or responses that i absolutely should not use? i appreciate everyone sharing their perspectives and experiences above. but it sounds like is it going to be a major, non-ending headache. tx.</p>

             <p>We to have been harassed by the Census Bureau, 3 visits last week, one of them on Saturday. We have started locking the gate at the road. I also contacted my Congressman who is going to call them and tell them to knock it off. We will see if that works. My research has reveled that those against this are mostly Republicans, so if your Congressman is a Democrat it may not help. Last year the house voted to de-fund the ACS, but the Senate restored the funding. Also the Rutherford Institute is preparing a lawsuit challenging the Census Bureaus authority to conduct the ACS. They said to: Specifically, let us know immediately if you are subjected to:</p> 
             <p>* A specific threat of prosecution as a result of your response (or lack thereof) to the ACS.</p> 
             <p>* Harassment and/or threats by Census Bureau employees relating to the ACS</p> 
             <p>* Excessive phone calls or calls at unreasonable hours relating to the ACS</p> 
             <p>* Visits by Census employees to your residence after dark, especially if they approach your residence from the back or sides, look in through windows, or take any other actions to invade your privacy beyond calling and coming to your front door. If any of these things has happened to you PLEASE contact them. They WILL be back in touch in a day or so.</p>

               <p>Thank you Sid so much!! I just filled out a request with Rutherford. This harrassment is horrible!! Just tonight I had a census worker knock on my front door from 7:30 p.m. to past 8:00 p.m. . then go around to my back door!!! Then  he went to our parking lot and I saw her going around my car  obviously taking down the license plate number. She sat in her car next to mine until 9:00 p.m. I guess she was waiting for me to come out. They have been coming around since early January 2013 leaving cards in both front and back doors. I did call and let them know that I had mailed in the form (I really did but it was blank ) I had an identity theft incident happen to me in 2010 that cost me almost $6,000 and I wasnt about to give ANYONE the answers to the very personal questions that were asked so that it could happen again. No way!! Anyway, the first time they came to my BACK door, not the front door, I told her I had mailed in the form  she said they hadnt received it. I said I didnt care, but I HAD already mailed in their form. Then it started. So thanks to you, I did contact Rutherford. God bless you, Sid!!</p>

                 <p>You are very welcome Suzanne. Hang in there. The best immediate advise Ive seen comes from an attorney on another web site. He said when the Census worker came on his property he asked them if they had a court order. When the worker said no, he told them to get the hell off his property and dont come back. They havent.<br> I found out that in my state if you tell anyone that and they do come back they are trespassing and can be arrested. That is my plan if they come back to my house.</p>
