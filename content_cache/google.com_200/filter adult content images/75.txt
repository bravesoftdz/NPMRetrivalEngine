    <h3 id="overview-holacdn" text="What is HolaCDN?">What is HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN is the first CDN built specifically for video delivery. HolaCDN is an overlay which sits on top of your existing CDN; it does not require any changes to your existing infrastructure. HolaCDN uses both client and server technologies to: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Provide detailed video user experience statistics</li> 
     <li>Instantly enable your videos to stream from multiple CDNs</li> 
     <li>Reduce video failure rates</li> 
     <li>Improve video start times and seek times</li> 
     <li>Reduce probability and duration of buffering</li> 
     <li>Improve video bitrates</li> 
     <li>Reduce video delivery costs</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="overview-better" text="Why is HolaCDN better?"> What makes HolaCDN faster and cheaper, compared with existing CDNs?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN was built from the ground up to specifically handle video traffic. HolaCDN is the only CDN able to perform <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a>, which means a single video will be fetched from multiple servers.<br> HolaCDN "auctions" video segments between <a href="#serverside">HolaCDN servers</a> and the existing CDN(s). The first few segments are served by the fastest servers available, and subsequent segments are served by servers that may be located in other regions.<br> By fetching most segments from Hola low-cost CDN, Hola reduces costs while improving performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="overview-components" text="HolaCDN's Components"> Which components make up HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p>HolaCDN is composed of client-side and server-side components, as well as a portal for monitoring and configuration.</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Client-side components</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li> <a href="#statistics"><b>Free video analytics module</b></a>: A collection of video streaming events, as experienced by the specific user, presented for analysis on a dashboard </li> 
       <li> <a href="#multicdn"><b>Free mid-stream switching module</b></a>: Dynamically select the best performing CDN for each segment of video from one or more existing CDNs. Creates a faster and more reliable delivery experience for the user, and enables you to use multiple CDNs. </li> 
       <li><a href="#bwsaver"><b>Bandwidth saver</b></a>: Saves 30-40% bandwidth on progressive video downloads, by requesting large video files in small segments.</li> 
       <li><a href="#player"><b>Optional - Free Hola video player</b></a>: Open-source, full-featured video player based on VideoJS.</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><b>Server-side components</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li><a href="#serverside"><b>HolaCDN streaming module</b></a>: Streams video content in segments to HolaCDN clients</li> 
       <li> <a href="#howitworks"><b>Fast Start module</b></a>: Fetches the first chunks of video from the fastest servers available, to ensure the video starts fast, and later continues from other servers </li> 
       <li> <a href="#tech-overhead"><b>Content distribution module</b></a>: Uses your existing CDN as the origin server once, and distributes content between the various HolaCDN servers </li> 
       <li> <a href="#howitworks-improving"><b>Fastest service backplane</b></a>: Collect network speed data from clients and convey to other clients for intelligent, real-time client side decisions </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><b>Portal components</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li><a href="#statistics"><b>User experience dashboard</b></a>: View granular video performance metrics as experienced by your end-users</li> 
       <li> <a href="#multicdn"><b>HolaCDN configuration dashboard</b></a>: Granular control for deployment and A/B testing on your websites and applications</li> 
       <li> <a href="#multicdn-operation"><b>MultiCDN manager</b></a>: Route traffic to different CDNs based on dynamic client decision or static rules </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="overview-statistics" text="Why are some modules free?"> Why are some elements totally free?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN's user experience dashboard and MultiCDN manager and player are 100% free. <br> These elements enable you to measure and improve your video performance. We believe that until today, CDN providers avoided discussing video user experience, since it was not possible to measure it well, and therefore, not possible to improve it much.<br> HolaCDN's new tech makes dramatic improvement possible to all metrics, so we wish to put this discussion back on the table. You can then choose to use HolaCDN streaming servers, and only for traffic used, with no minimum commitments. </p> 
    <h3 id="overview-p2p" text="Does HolaCDN use P2P?">Does HolaCDN use P2P?</h3> 
    <p> No. HolaCDN is based on a proprietary network of our own servers. We believe that the ecosystem and technologies are not ripe for P2P video distribution. HolaCDN does not use P2P or any P2P resource or upload bandwidth.<br> HolaCDN's parent company, Hola, has a separate product division called 'Hola P2P VPN' and is otherwise unrelated.<br> HolaCDN does not use resources of the Hola P2P VPN network. </p> 
    <h2 id="tech" text="How does HolaCDN work?">How does HolaCDN work?</h2> 
    <h3 id="tech-implementationguide" text="How to I implement HolaCDN?"> How do I implement HolaCDN on my website and/or apps?</h3> 
    <p> See the <a href="#imp">'Starting to use HolaCDN'</a> section. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-switching" text="What is mid-stream switching?"> What is mid-stream switching, and how does it work?</h3> 
    <p> Mid-stream switching is HolaCDN's ability to download video segments from multiple servers or CDNs while a video is playing.<br> HolaCDN's mid-stream switching improves video start times, reduces buffering and improves video bitrates - simply because multiple sources are available, and the player can switch to the best available source at any given time. The decision on where to download the video segment from is done by the HolaCDN JS client. The client keeps track of the player's buffer, as well as download speeds of video segments from multiple servers. It also receives information about network speeds from the HolaCDN network. The decision is made in real time, for every video segment, and takes into account the user's link speed at the time of the decision.<br> Allowing individual clients to make decisions is a more granular way of making decisions, as opposed to a centralized server, and guarantees improved performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-raid" text="HolaCDN analogy to RAID controller"> What do you mean when you say that HolaCDN is like a RAID controller for CDNs? </h3> 
    <p> Before RAID storage controllers became common, customers needed to buy extremely high-end systems in order to enjoy fast and redundant storage systems. These systems were expensive because they used high-end SCSI drives and often high speed interconnections.<br> The introduction of the RAID controller changed this reality significantly. With a simple, inexpensive RAID controller, customers could now connect multiple off-the-shelf inexpensive hard drives on which the content was duplicated. When the controller fetched data, it requested it from multiple low cost storage devices, and the first to provide data back was used. So while on average, each low cost storage device was slower and less reliable than a high-end system, aggregated together they provided higher reliability (due to duplication), faster speeds (because of the auction in which the first device to respond would be selected) and lower costs.<br> In CDN terms, HolaCDN's client-side JavaScript is like the RAID controller. It allows using the HolaCDN network of low cost servers, which are hosted in various geographies, to provide higher performance and reliability at a fraction of the cost of traditional CDNs.<br> Just like with RAID, using low-cost elements did not come at the expense of performance. In fact, the opposite is true - performance is improved. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-price" text="Why is the price so low?"> How is the HolaCDN streaming cost less than other CDNs?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN was built from the ground up to handle only video traffic, and video is very different from web traffic. HolaCDN's client-server architecture allows it to achieve video optimizations, which are not possible with existing CDNs. The HolaCDN client is able to get traffic from multiple low cost servers and combine it into video which performs better than video that is coming from a single high performance server. HolaCDN keeps its operational costs low by:<br> </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Leveraging the mid-stream switching technology, which much like a RAID controller, allows leasing off-the shelf, low cost servers</li> 
     <li>Hosting these servers at inexpensive hosting locations</li> 
     <li>Spreading traffic loads across all geographies by using all servers for all customers regardless of geographical location</li> 
     <li>Utilizing all servers at 95% utilization levels, reducing the total number of servers required.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> These methods might look unusual, when compared with traditional CDNs. That's fine. HolaCDN is not just another CDN. It is a radically new approach to video delivery.<br> <br> See the analogy: <a href="#tech-raid">why is HolaCDN a lot like a RAID controller?</a> </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-hola_as_cdn" text="Must I use a CDN with Hola?"> Do I have to use a CDN with Hola?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN latches on to your existing CDN infrastructure, making it faster, cheaper and more reliable, and enables you to get detailed QoE statistics and to use multiple CDNs to ensure further reliability and cost reductions. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-dnsurlchange" text="Existing URLs/DNS settings"> Do I need to change any of my URLs or DNS settings to use HolaCDN</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN works out of the box with your existing URLs and DNS settings. There is no need to change anything. The HolaCDN client code intercepts requests for video chunks from the player. It uses <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a> to select the optimal server in real-time, and stream each chunk from that server. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-originoverhead" text="Origin shield"> Will HolaCDN overload my origin servers? Does HolaCDN offer Origin Shielding?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN pulls first copies of the video <strong>from your existing CDN, and not from your origin server</strong>. You may choose to configure HolaCDN to also be able to pull video from your origin, but this is not needed and rarely done. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-overhead" text="Will it overload my CDN?"> Will HolaCDN overload my existing CDN?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN was designed so that it will never overload your origin or existing CDN. HolaCDN uses multiple 'origin protection' mechanisms to ensure that your existing CDN will not incur significant overhead. </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> For both VoD and live video, only <strong>one server</strong> downloads the first copy of the video from your existing CDN. Other HolaCDN servers will then download required copies from that server. </li> 
     <li> The single HolaCDN server which downloads the first copies from your existing CDN will <strong>only download the required segments</strong> of a video and not the entire video. It will immediately start serving those segments, offloading your existing CDN. </li> 
     <li> Every HolaCDN server delivers video segments to thousands of users. The net result is <strong>significant offloading</strong> of the existing CDN. </li> 
     <li> HolaCDN servers will typically download <strong>under 2% of the traffic</strong> they serve to clients from your origin server or CDN.<br> The information is clearly visible on the control panel, as shown in the screenshot below: </li> 
    </ul> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//a6z6y7e8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/origin_traffic.png?md5=23260-4c617f5f"> 
    <h3 id="tech-cancelledrequests" text="Cancelled requests"> Why do I see red lines of cancelled HTTP requests for video chunks in my developer console? Is this normal? </h3> 
    <p> You may see HTTP 503 (service unavailable) errors in your developer console when using HolaCDN. <strong>This behaviour is normal and expected</strong>. <br> HolaCDN uses <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a> to stream video chunks from multiple servers while the video is playing. The algorithm makes real-time decisions, using information regarding the user's Internet connection, video quality, player buffer size and other factors.<br> In some cases, the algorithm may decide it is better to abort/cancel an HTTP request and issue a new request, for example to a different server. In these cases, the console may show aborted requests, but they have no negative impact on performance. You can safely ignore these errors. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-serverspeed" text="Measuring server speeds"> How does HolaCDN measure the speed of video servers? Does it add overhead?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN's <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a> technology enables it to download video chunks from multiple servers. Every time a video chunk is downloaded from a server, the HolaCDN client calculates its speed by using the size of the video chunk, and the time it took to download that chunk. This is effectively an ongoing 'speedtest', but one that does not add any traffic or overhead. It allows HolaCDN to have real-time information regarding individual server response times, factoring in server load, internet connectivity to that specific server, etc. The HolaCDN system communicates this server speed information to nearby clients so that they can anticipate server speeds and make smarter selections. <br> It is easy to see this in action by <a href="/">using the demo on Holacdn.com</a>. Open the 'Detailed statistics' screen and note that every time a video chunk is downloaded from a server, that server's speed is updated. <br> The only time HolaCDN performs a speedtest that adds traffic is the first time it is used on your site, in order to improve video start times. See <a href="#howitworks-improving">how HolaCDN improves video start time.</a> </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-throughput" text="Throughput and bitrate"> I use high bitrate video which requires high throughput, can HolaCDN handle it? </h3> 
    <p> Throughput and video bitrates are not the same. It is possible to deliver a high-bitrate video stream with different throughputs.<br> HolaCDN uses its fast start servers to ensure that the video starts fast, and to allow the player to create a 20-30 second buffer. This inherent buffer allows for many of the optimizations that HolaCDN provides.<br> Once the buffer is in place, as long as the time it takes to download a video segment is shorter than the video duration, the buffer will always be full, and there is no risk of buffering.<br> For example, if a 2Mbyte segment contains 10 seconds of video, it does not matter if this segment is fetched in 300msec (high throughput), or in 900msec (slower throughput), because every segment delivered is 10 seconds long. The buffer will not be compromised.<br> Video on HolaCDN is delivered from multiple servers. Each server will have a different throughput. HolaCDN always selects the best server to deliver the video in a way which will maintain or improve video quality, reduce buffering and reduce costs. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-traditional" text="HolaCDN vs. other CDNs"> How is HolaCDN different from traditional CDNs, such as Akamai and Cloudfront? </h3> 
    <p> For 20 years, CDNs have worked by connecting the user with the closest server to that user. This results in pretty good performance during off-peak hours, and mediocre performance during peak hours when the content is most needed. The reason for this is that many users in the same geographical area will try to connect to the same server(s) closest to them. HolaCDN solves this problem by splitting large MP4 video into segments (or, in the case of HLS/HDS, uses existing segments). HolaCDN then takes the first few segments from servers close by (for fast start times). All other segments are taken from servers in other geographical locations (for offloading and higher bandwidth). This improves the user experience of your videos, while reducing the costs, because of HolaCDN's better server utilization. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-newer_cdns" text="HolaCDN vs. newer CDNs"> How is HolaCDN different from newer CDNs, like Fastly?</h3> 
    <p> Fastly's architecture is similar to Akamai's, except that Fastly uses high end servers to provide faster service. Videos with Fastly should start faster and buffer less. In fact, Fastly is often too fast for video, which ironically only increases cost, but does not result in noticeable performance improvement. HolaCDN uses high end servers ONLY for the first few seconds, and fetches the rest of the video from low end servers in parallel, thus creating a fast start (like Fastly), but with low cost and high bandwidth for the remaining parts of the video. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-p2p_cdns" text="HolaCDN vs. P2P CDNs"> How is HolaCDN different from pure P2P CDNs, like Streamroot or Peer5?</h3> 
    <p> Peer5, Streamroot and other P2P CDN solutions rely only on client technology and typically use the WebRTC protocol. They are subject to WebRTC/browser limitations, which results in low cache hit rates, especially for VoD traffic. HolaCDN uses client-side code working with server-side code. HolaCDN servers maintain persistent copies of the video files, thereby achieving extremely high cache hit ratio and higher level of effectiveness and performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-monitoring" text="HolaCDN vs. monitoring tools"> How is HolaCDN different from services like Conviva?</h3> 
    <p> Conviva is a user experience information system that gives publishers insight into their users' experience, allowing them to choose the best CDN according to specific criteria. Conviva uses historical data reported by clients, and a centralized server is used for estimating the best CDN. Conviva does not offer its own CDN, and does not offer free tools.<br> HolaCDN provides a <b>free</b> <a href="#statistics">user experience dashboard</a> that provides detailed user experience metrics, allowing you to accurately measure performance of one or more CDNs.<br> HolaCDN offers a <b>free</b> MultiCDN solution, which uses <a href="#tech-switching">real-time midstream switching</a> between CDNs. Switching decisions are <b>distributed</b>, performed by each end-user device, using <b>real-time</b> information, every 100msec.<br> HolaCDN also provides the CDN streaming service, which is cheaper and provides higher performance than the traditional CDNs from which Conviva selects. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-cedexis" text="HolaCDN vs. MultiCDN tools"> How is HolaCDN different from services like Cedexis?</h3> 
    <p> Cedexis measures performance of traditional CDNs and allows switching to the optimal CDN. Cedexis helps customers select between two or more traditional CDNs, and the selection process is done by consulting with a central server.<br> HolaCDN allows mid-stream switching between multiple traditional CDNs and HolaCDN, which is a video-only CDN and offers improved performance at a reduced cost. Furthermore, in HolaCDN all switching decisions are made by a real-time client-side code, on a segment-based level, while taking into account all of the user's link characteristics and performance. This distributed decision making offers improved, more accurate performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-onlyhola" text="Can I use HolaCDN on its own?"> Can I use HolaCDN as my only CDN?</h3> 
    <p> No. You need to keep your existing CDN, for a few reasons. </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>HolaCDN is a video CDN</b>: Because HolaCDN only handles video traffic, you will need a traditional CDN for other types of traffic, such as web, images, and audio.</li> 
     <li><b>HolaCDN is an overlay solution</b>: HolaCDN offloads video traffic from your existing CDN, but your existing CDN might still be used as a fallback if the need arises. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="tech-configapi" text="Can I configure via API?"> Can I configure HolaCDN using an API or do I have to use the control panel?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. You can read and/or modify HolaCDN configuration via API. The same API can also be used for enabling or disabling HolaCDN. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llww0bFiU7pK3thKDm0aUJU38550cLPneBBbEFfEU-0/edit#heading=h.7cu73cqvog1y">the step-by-step guide</a> for syntax and instructions. </p> 
    <h3 id="tech-iframes" text="Embedding HolaCDN in other sites"> Can I embed the HolaCDN JS in iFrames that I provide to other sites?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. You can include the HolaCDN JS in embed code that you provide to 3rd party sites. You can also have separate statistics for each embedded JS. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llww0bFiU7pK3thKDm0aUJU38550cLPneBBbEFfEU-0/edit#heading=h.31apnjdal1xk">the step-by-step guide</a> for syntax and instructions. </p> 
    <h2 id="howitworks" text="Improving QoE &amp; reducing cost">How does HolaCDN improve video experience and reduce costs?</h2> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-reduce_fail" text="Reducing play failures"> How does HolaCDN reduce video play failures?</h3> 
    <p> Typically, when a video starts playing, if the first video segment arrives too late or does not arrive at all, the video player may 'give up' and the video will not play. When using a traditional CDN (which uses a single server for the entire video stream), this can happen as a result of peak time load, or downtime. HolaCDN can fetch video segments from multiple servers for a single video stream. Video segments may be fetched from HolaCDN servers as well as from your existing CDN.<br> If the first video segments fail to arrive on time from your existing CDN, the HolaCDN client will attempt to download them from one or more HolaCDN servers deployed worldwide. This increases the probability of the video starting, and reduces play failures. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//a6z6y7e8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/play_failures.png?md5=67900-ac645717"> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-improving" text="Reducing start/seek times"> How does HolaCDN reduce video start and seek times?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN fetches video segments from multiple servers for a single video stream. Video segments can come from <a href="#serverside-fast_start">HolaCDN Fast Start servers</a> as well as from your existing CDN. For the first video segments, the HolaCDN JavaScript selects the fastest available source, for the fastest possible video start time.<br> To decide which source is fastest, the HolaCDN client collects information from several sources. First, it uses historical measured download speeds from different servers that the client saved on the device. If there are no historical measurements, it uses similar information measured by other users in the area. And lastly, if no information is available, it downloads the first 64K of data from all potential sources, effectively performing a 'speedtest' among them, and downloads the first video segments from the fastest one. Start times with HolaCDN can be same or better than they are with the existing CDN. The same logic and methods are applied to improve seek times. </p>

    <h3 id="howitworks-buffering" text="Reducing buffering"> How does HolaCDN reduce buffering?</h3> 
    <p> Videos buffer for different reasons. To see how HolaCDN reduces buffering, watch these short videos, or read the answer below: </p>

    </ul> 
    <p> HolaCDN can fetch video segments from multiple servers for a single video stream. These segments can be fetched from HolaCDN servers, as well as from your existing CDN. If one of the video sources is overloaded or slow, the HolaCDN client side JavaScript will identify this and request video segments from other servers on the network before any buffering occurs. If HolaCDN is not used, the entire video is retrieved from a single existing CDN server, and if that server is slow, end-users will experience buffering.<br> HolaCDN's ability to fetch video segments from multiple sources offers multiple levels of backup against buffering and reduces the probability of buffering for end-users.<br> It is impossible to eliminate buffering altogether, as some buffering can result from the end-users' slow last mile connections.<br> </p>

    <h3 id="howitworks-bitrates" text="Improving bitrates"> How does HolaCDN improve my video quality/bitrate?</h3> 
    <p> In traditional CDNs, when the selected video source is overloaded or slow, buffering is prevented by gradually reducing the video bitrate, which results in loss of quality.<br> The HolaCDN client-side Javascript measures performance every 100msec. If it identifies reduced server performance, it will request other available servers on the network for the high-bitrate video segments needed. Only if it cannot find such high-bitrate segments on any other server, will the bitrate be reduced by the player.<br> HolaCDN's ability to fetch video segments from multiple sources by using mid-stream switching offers multiple levels of backup against reduced bitrates.<br> With HolaCDN, the average bitrates will be same or better than those without HolaCDN. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//u3t4s5w8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/video_quality.png?md5=55453-efbf779a"> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-live" text="Live streaming performance"> Does HolaCDN introduce an additional delay when doing live streaming?</h3> 
    <p>No. When a live stream is detected, HolaCDN fetches the live stream from your existing CDN, by polling it every second. As a result, HolaCDN servers have a copy of the live video 2-3 seconds after they appear on the original CDN.<br> Video players playing live video always maintain a buffer (typically 30-60 seconds) to prevent buffering in case of variations in bandwidth or server response times. This means that at the time live video becomes available on HolaCDN servers, video players are still playing video from the buffer.<br> By the time the buffer is depleted and new live segments are requested, these segments already reside on HolaCDN servers. As a result, live video segments from HolaCDN will be played at the exact same time as they would have if they were fetched from the existing CDN, with no additional delay. </p> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-liveseek" text="Live traffic DVR"> My live streams include a DVR-like ability to seek back in time. Does HolaCDN support this mode? </h3> 
    <p>Yes. All HolaCDN benefits apply to previously recorded live video that the user seeks back to when working in DVR mode.</p> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-spikes" text="HolaCDN and traffic spikes"> Some of my video traffic is irregular, with high traffic spikes occurring without any notice. How does HolaCDN deal with it? </h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN was designed to work well with irregular traffic. Unlike traditional CDNs which serve content from only one of a few servers that are located close to the user, HolaCDN uses multiple servers deployed worldwide.<br> When a local traffic spike occurs (for example: a major news event causing a surge of live video traffic), traditional CDNs will quickly become loaded in the related regions, resulting in reduced bitrates and/or end-user buffering.<br> That same traffic spike on HolaCDN will not result in buffering. When a HolaCDN server detects high volumes of traffic on a given video file or live stream, the server will replicate the content to another HolaCDN server in the same or other location. The additional server will now share the load with the first server, and the mid-stream switching performed by the client-side JavaScript will now have an additional video source to choose from. The total number of video sources increases, they are available worldwide, and the client-side has more sources to choose from.<br> The process of a new server becoming an additional source for a video file or live stream is automatic and takes seconds. When demand for the video starts to decrease, the HolaCDN servers added for playing the video will gradually leave the pool of sources and become sources for other video URLs.<br> Essentially, the system automatically expands and shrinks dynamically as required. </p> 
    <h3 id="howitworks-long_tail" text="HolaCDN and long tail traffic"> My videos are 'long tail' and I found it is not economical for me to use a traditional CDN. Is HolaCDN different? </h3> 
    <p> If your viewers watch many different videos (long tail), they will hit the local caching servers on a traditional CDN with requests for many different files in a short period of time. The caching servers will serve those files and cache them, but because each video is viewed infrequently, the video file will be removed from the cache to support new file requests coming in. The next requests for the files that were removed will cause the caching servers to fetch them from the origin servers again. Because this method of work causes load on the origin servers, which results in slower video load times, it is often not economical to use traditional CDNs for long tail content.<br> HolaCDN caches only the first few seconds of each video, by using servers located close to where the viewers are watching it, and while the main body of the video is cached in several servers around the world. This enables caching of much larger libraries of content close to the users for a fast start, and continuing from other servers on the HolaCDN network. This approach reduces cache misses and load on the origin server, and makes long tail video distribution a practical reality.<br> This is also enabled by the fact that whereas traditional CDNs use DNS redirection of entire domains to re-route to caching servers, HolaCDN caches video on a per URL level, allowing different videos to be fetched from different locations. </p> 
    <h2 id="monetization" text="Improving monetization">How does HolaCDN improve video ad performance and increase monetization?</h2> 
    <h3 id="monetization-overview" text="Improving video ads">How does HolaCDN improve my video ads and user experience?</h3> 
    <p> Video ads are an especially challenging type of video, and have not received the right attention by CDNs. When ads fail to play or don't start fast enough, more users will simply give up, never viewing the ad, resulting in lost revenue.<br> Users expect high performance video both for the ad and for the post-ad content which they intended to see in the first place. HolaCDN improves both pre-roll and mid-roll video ad performance using the following methods: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Collecting video ad analytics</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li> Measuring ad fill and success rates:<br> Collection of metrics such as ads loaded, completed, timed out, and skipped by user.<br> </li> 
       <li> Measuring video ad performance:<br> Collection of video ad user performance metrics such as start time, and buffering. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><b>Improving video ad start time and reducing fail rate</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li>Accelerating start times:<br> Reducing the time to first frame for video ads, by using HolaCDN Fast Start servers. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><b>Improving post-ad video start</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li>Accelerating post-ad content:<br> Reducing the start time of the video that follows the ad, by using HolaCDN to preload the video while the ad is playing. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="monetization-success" text="Increasing success rates">How does HolaCDN increase the success rate and reduce the start time for video ads?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN allows the publisher to improve video ad success rate and start time, by letting the publisher configure running the ads through the HolaCDN network (without needing to coordinate with the ad network), using the same <a href="#howitworks-reduce_fail">technology</a> used for accelerating other videos. </p> 
    <h3 id="monetization-videofaststart" text="Reducing video loading time"> How does HolaCDN improve the start time for content after the video ads is finished? </h3> 
    <p> Because HolaCDN has a client side module, this module is used for preloading the video content which the user wanted to watch in the first place while the video ad is playing. As a result, the video will start as soon as the ad is completed (or skipped).<br> Note that preloading of video is done only after the web page is fully loaded, so that page load time remains fast. </p> 
    <h3 id="monetization-formats" text="Supported advertising modes"> Is HolaCDN compatible with preroll/midroll advertising? With ads stitched into the video stream? </h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN works with any kind of advertising inserted into the video stream - MP4 preroll/midroll, and DAI (Dynamic Ad Insertion) type ads.<br> The HolaCDN control panel allows you to configure whether HolaCDN handles the video ads in addition to the video itself, or skips video ads altogether: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li>If you choose to have HolaCDN skip MP4 advertisements, they will be retrieved from the original ad server, and HolaCDN will resume operation after the ad is completed. </li> 
     <li>If you choose to optimize your video ads, HolaCDN will improve their success rates and start times. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> Similarly, in-stream advertisements are detected by HolaCDN client and can be either transparently passed through to the original advertising server(s), or optimized by HolaCDN.<br> In either case, your systems will continue to function just as they do without HolaCDN. </p> 
    <h2 id="compat" text="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2> 
    <h3 id="compat-cdns" text="Compatibility with other CDNs"> Is HolaCDN compatible with my existing CDN(s)?</h3> 
    <p> Yes, Hola can work with any existing CDN, origin server, or a combination of the two. If you are already using two or more CDNs, HolaCDN can still offload them and provide benefits. <a href="/?hola_zone=fastest&amp;hola_graph=cache_off">Click here</a> to see a demo taking the first few chunks from the existing CDN. </p>

    <h3 id="compat-ads" text="Supported advertising modes">Is HolaCDN compatible with preroll/midroll advertising? With ads stitched into the video stream?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. See the <a href="#monetization-formats">monetization section</a> for additional details. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-segmentsize" text="Supported video segment size"> My system uses different video segment sizes. Does HolaCDN support this?</h3> 
    <p> Most implementations use a segment size of 10 seconds for HLS and 5 seconds for HDS. Because HolaCDN servers simply cache HTTP objects, HolaCDN works with any segment size. The client side algorithm automatically adjusts itself according to the segment size used in the specific stream. Some of our customers use segment sizes of 2-4 seconds. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-content_platforms" text="Online Video Platforms (OVPs)"> Is HolaCDN compatible with my video platform (e.g. Kaltura, Brightcove)? </h3> 
    <p>Yes, HolaCDN can work with online video platforms, specifically:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Brightcove</b>: Supported. See the <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/install.md#31-brightcove">Github page for Brightcove integration</a> </li>

    </ul> 
    <h3 id="compat-live_platforms" text="Live video platforms"> Is HolaCDN compatible with my live video streaming platform (e.g. Wowza, Nimble streamer)? </h3> 
    <p> Yes, HolaCDN can work with any live streaming platform. Specifically, HolaCDN offers transparent support for <a href="https://wmspanel.com/nimble">Nimble Streamer</a> when using protected streams. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-hls_aes" text="AES encrypted HLS">Does HolaCDN support HLS streams encrypted with AES-128 encryption?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-https" text="Video over HTTPS">Does Hola support video over HTTPS? Do I need to import SSL certificates to HolaCDN servers?</h3> 
    <p> HTTPS video is supported; no special configuration is required. There is no need to upload HTTPS/SSL certificates to HolaCDN servers. Per GB price for HolaCDN streaming is identical for HTTP and for HTTPS. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-vr360" text="360/VR video">Does HolaCDN support 360 degree / virtual reality video?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-yt_dm" text="YouTube/DailyMotion">I use only YouTube and/or DailyMotion videos in my site. Can HolaCDN improve these services?</h3> 
    <p> No. HolaCDN is an overlay which sits on top of your existing CDN. It is not compatible with YouTube or DailyMotion embedded videos. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-chunksize" text="Custom chunk sizes">Is HolaCDN compatible with non-standard video chunk sizes?</h3> 
    <p> Yes.<br> Some customers choose to change (typically reduce) default chunk sizes. This is typically done in order to accelerate video start time and to make the video more responsive while seeking. Reducing chunk sizes increases load on the video servers and CDNs.<br> For example, default HLS chunk sizes are 10 seconds, but some implementations go as low as 2 seconds. In any case, HolaCDN supports any chunk size. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-4k" text="4K video">Does HolaCDN support 4K video?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN supports all resolutions and formats, because it caches HTTP video segments. HolaCDN works well with any video segment size. Some of our customers are using 12-15MB HLS video segments with no issues. </p> 
    <h3 id="compat-html5encoding" text="HTML5 encoding settings">What are the recommended encoding settings to ensure my HTML5 video is compatible with all browsers?</h3> 
    <p> Modern web browsers generally support HTML5 video, but not all of them use the same decoding. Since video can be encoded in different ways, it may play differently on different browsers.<br> To ensure optimal compatibility for all browsers, HolaCDN recommends using the following encoding settings: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Progressive video (MP4)</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li>No negative ctts (pts should be &gt;= dts)</li> 
       <li>All frames should have the same duration</li> 
       <li>Every I-frame should be IDR (no references to the previous GOP)</li> 
       <li>Include an IDR frame every 3-5 seconds</li> 
       <li>Use baseline profile</li> 
       <li>Encode at 25-30 frames per second</li> 
       <li>Use AAC-LC encoding</li> 
       <li>No transformation matrix (identity)/color matrix</li> 
       <li>moov box in the beginning of the video</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li><b>Adaptive video (HLS)</b> 
      <ul> 
       <li>No negative ctts (pts should be &gt;= dts)</li> 
       <li>All frames should have the same duration</li> 
       <li>Every I-frame should be IDR (no references to the previous GOP)</li> 
       <li>Include an IDR frame every 3-5 seconds</li> 
       <li>Use baseline profile</li> 
       <li>Encode at 25-30 frames per second</li> 
       <li>The first frame of each segment should be key frame</li> 
       <li>Avoid multiple tracks (combined video/audio track)</li> 
       <li>Don't use range bytes for segments (each is the whole file)</li> 
       <li>Use quality levels (3-4 are usually enough for FullHD, 2-3 for 1366x768, more for UHD)</li> 
       <li>For live traffic, include at least 10 segments per playlist</li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul>

    <h3 id="imp-cors" text="What is CORS?">What is CORS?</h3> 
    <p> Browsers have a "same-origin" protection that prevents web pages accessing resources from multiple domains using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX">AJAX</a>) calls.<br> Modern sites provide their content from multiple domains, and thus need a protocol to allow controlling this protection.<br> <b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">CORS</a>)</b> is a protocol created to assure using multiple resources on the same web page. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-cors_hola" text="HolaCDN and CORS"> I never used CORS before. Why do I need it with HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p>There are 2 possible reasons why you may need CORS configuration with HolaCDN:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Your website uses progressive download media player:</b> When a media player delivers a video file (such as MP4/FLV/WebM) by using progressive download, it downloads the file in one piece from your origin CDN. This technique is implemented using a video-tag (&lt;video&gt;) which was waved out from the <a href="#imp-cors">"same-origin" policy resource restrictions</a>.<br> HolaCDN will request the same video, but in small segments, using AJAX, in order to <a href="#bwsaver">reduce bandwidth usage</a>. Using AJAX fall under the <a href="#imp-cors">"same-origin" policy resource restrictions</a>, therefore the browser will use CORS to fetch them from your CDN. HolaCDN servers are already support CORS, allowing access to all origins (<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>).<br> In this case, you will have to <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/CORS.md">configure your servers</a>, that hold your video content, to do the same or at least grant your web page domain accessing them (<code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [your video origin domain]</code>). </li> 
     <img class="ext_img" src="//s2c2w8t4.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cors.png?md5=44862-d3f52caf"> 
     <li> <b>Your CORS whitelist configuration doesn't include HolaCDN servers:</b> In this case, HolaCDN's servers will not be permitted to get the content they need in order to play the video. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> See our <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/CORS.md">CORS config page</a> for details. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-cors_config" text="When is CORS required?"> How do I know if I need to configure CORS?</h3> 
    <p> The need to configure CORS arises from the combination between the type of media player you are using and the type of video files it plays: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> If you're using an <b>HTML5-based</b> player, the answer is YES. Enabling HolaCDN to successfully retrieve the video files from your server, without performance degradation, requires configuring CORS settings on your web servers. </li> 
     <li> If your website is using a <b>FLASH</b> player (such as JW Player or Flowplayer), you will NOT be required to configure CORS.<br> FLASH technology handles cross-origin resource sharing a bit differently than HTML5:<br> 
      <ul> 
       <li> A cross-domain policy file <code>crossdomain.xml</code> is configured on the server side, containing a list of domains that are allowed to access the server's resources. </li> 
       <li> Once a cross-domain request for a resource is made, the remote domain will verify that the requestor's domain is listed in his cross-domain policy file and will allow the transaction accordingly. </li> 
      </ul> Because your website is already up and running, it is safe to assume you already configured this when you first started using a CDN. </li>
     <li> If your site uses a <b>FLASH player with progressive MP4</b> - you will need to configure CORS in addition to the existing cross-domain configuration. </li>  
    </ul> 
    <p> See our <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/CORS.md">CORS config page</a> for details. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-cors_limited" text="CORS domain settings"> Do I have to allow 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' - meaning, to all domains?</h3> 
    <p> Use the settings specified in the <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/CORS.md">CORS config page</a>. CORS are configured the same way in many video leading video sites like CNN, (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/11/18/boy-called-hero-for-saving-baby-brother-alisyn-camerota-john-berman-sot-newday.cnn">example</a>), Facebook, (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/candaceSpayne/videos/10209653193067040/">example</a>), Twitter, (<a href="https://twitter.com/video?lang=en&amp;lang=en">example</a>). </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-no_cors" text="I cannot configure CORS"> I cannot change my CORS configuration. Can I still use holaCDN?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN recommends enabling CORS settings for optimal performance with progressive video streaming. HolaCDN can still work if you are unable to configure CORS, but there are differences in how the system will operate.<br> </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>HolaCDN Video Analytics:</b> Analytics do not require any changes to CORS settings and as such, will work normally even when CORS is not configured. </li> 
     <li> <b>Traffic from HolaCDN servers:</b> Missing CORS headers means that HolaCDN will effectively become the only CDN delivering video to your users. 
      <ul> 
       <li> HolaCDN servers will get the first copy of the video from your CDN. </li> 
       <li> Your users will get all their video only from HolaCDN servers. This also means cost savings are maximized if your existing CDN is more expensive than HolaCDN. </li> 
       <li> HolaCDN will perform <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a>, but only between different HolaCDN servers e.g. if a specific HolaCDN server is slow or unavailable, video will be streamed from another HolaCDN server. </li> 
       <li> Since HolaCDN will not be able to serve traffic to users from your existing CDN, it cannot be used as fallback. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> HolaCDN does not require CORS configuration for modern adaptive streaming protocols like HLS, HDS etc. Adaptive streaming offers many advantages over progressive streaming, and it might make sense to consider moving to adaptive protocols in general. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-get_content" text="How does HolaCDN get content?"> How does HolaCDN obtain first copies of videos to send to users? Do I need to upload content to HolaCDN servers? </h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN uses a 'pull' model. There is no need to upload (or 'push') any content to HolaCDN servers.<br> HolaCDN servers fetch video from either your existing CDN or your origin server(s) as these video segments are first requested by users.<br> You can specify as many origin servers and/or CDNs as needed, as you can see in the screenshot below. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//u3t4s5w8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/video_sources.png?md5=6399-12dcf192"> 
    <h3 id="imp-protection" text="Existing content protection"> My content is protected against hotlinking using tokens. How does HolaCDN handle this?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN only caches video chunks. It does not handle manifest files (e.g. M3U8/F4M/MPD). In many cases, token authentication is only applied to the manifest file and not to video chunks. In this case, HolaCDN will work with no additional configuration. <br> Thus, the following answer is only relevant if video chunks themselves are protected using tokens. <br> HolaCDN servers must be able to fetch the initial copy of video chunks from your servers or CDN in order to serve video to users. When video chunks are protected using tokens, HolaCDN can use a few methods in order to be able to fetch them, for example: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Whitelist HolaCDN servers:</b> Whitelisting a few HolaCDN servers will allow them to fetch video from your existing CDN and to send it to other HolaCDN servers. The list of IP addresses to whitelist appears in your HolaCDN portal. </li> 
     <li> <b>Receive a token from the existing system:</b> HolaCDN servers request a token (via API) from your existing CDN, and use this token to fetch video chunks from it. </li> 
     <li> <b>Generate a token on HolaCDN servers:</b> HolaCDN servers generate the token, and use it to fetch video chunks from your existing CDN. This mode requires you to share the token generation algorithm with HolaCDN. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> For additional details, visit <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/install.md#5-handling-content-protection">the GitHub page</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-holaprotection" text="Hotlinking protection"> Does HolaCDN protect my content from hotlinking?</h3> 
    <p> Content stored on HolaCDN servers can be easily protected using referrer protection, time-limit, IP encoding or a combination of these methods. <a href="/#contact">Contact us</a> to discuss specific implementation. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-geoblock" text="Geo-blocked content"> My content is geo-blocked; it can only be watched by users in [country xyz]. Can HolaCDN work with geo-blocked video? Will my geo-blocking be affected?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN will not change any geo-blocking policies that you have in place. Only users in [country xyz] will be able to watch your videos.<br> <br> HolaCDN servers must be able to fetch the initial copy of video chunks from your servers or CDN in order to serve video to users. If your content is geo-blocked, some HolaCDN servers might not be able to fetch video from your servers.<br> In order to allow HolaCDN servers access to geo-blocked content, simply whitelist the IP addresses of a few HolaCDN servers. The list of HolaCDN server IP addresses to whitelist can be found in <a href="/cp/tools/integration">your HolaCDN portal.</a> </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-whitelistservers" text="Servers to whitelist"> If I need to whitelist servers, how many do I need to whitelist? Does the list change frequently?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN deploys thousands of servers in multiple locations around the globe, but you need to whitelist only a few of them. The list of server IP addresses to whitelist is available both on the <a href="/cp/tools/integration">HolaCDN portal</a> and via API.<br> The list is updated every few weeks. Importantly, if your whitelist is not fully up to date, HolaCDN will continue working normally. HolaCDN support will detect your out-of-date whitelist and contact you. You can then update the list whenever convenient. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-drm" text="DRM support">Does HolaCDN support DRM?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN supports DRM via simple configuration - <a href="mailto:support@holaspark.com">contact us</a> to find the best solution for your specific needs. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-failure" text="Is HolaCDN a single point of failure?"> If HolaCDN servers are slow or down, will my users' QoE suffer?</h3> 
    <p> No. When the HolaCDN servers cannot provide video segments, your video player will simply fetch those segments from your existing CDN, just like it did before HolaCDN was added, at the original cost and performance.<br> You can test this yourself by either using the demo extension on your website, or playing with the <a href="/">online demo</a> - play a video, and disable the HolaCDN servers one by one. You will see that video continues to be downloaded, initially from other HolaCDN servers, then finally from the existing CDN, with no interruption. Thus, with HolaCDN, the overall reliability of your video delivery is same or better. Since it has a fallback option, HolaCDN is not a single point of failure </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-testing" text="Testing HolaCDN gradually"> Is it possible to test HolaCDN performance on an individual video, or a subset of videos? </h3> 
    <p> Yes. There are two ways to do this. One is to add the HolaCDN JavaScript only to the specific video's web page(s). The other is to add the HolaCDN JavaScript to a larger section of the site, and create a special zone in the HolaCDN control panel using regular expression filtering. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-matchers" text="Controlling when HolaCDN is used"> How can I specify exactly when/where HolaCDN is used?</h3> 
    <p> You can granularly configure when HolaCDN will be used. Simply define zones for different content groups within your HolaCDN dashboard. For each such zone you can configure when videos will stream from the HolaCDN network according to the following matchers: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>URL and platform match</b><br> Supports simple matching by URL and/or OS type.<br> For advanced matching, you can write your own rule with JavaScript.<br> <img src="//u3t4s5w8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cdnfaq_match_advance.png?md5=21948-f976771c"> </li> 
     <li> <b>Geographical match</b><br> Include or exclude users by country. HolaCDN examines the user's IP address and decides if HolaCDN should be enabled or not. The HolaCDN GeoIP database is updated weekly.<br> Example: Exclude users from Brazil. HolaCDN will be used for everyone except for Brazilian users. Users in Brazil will fetch all their video chunks from your existing CDN.<br> <img src="//s2c2w8t4.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cdnfaq_match_geo.png?md5=11056-c1bfa1e7"> </li> 
     <li> <b>Time of day matching</b><br> Enable HolaCDN only part of the day.<br> Example: Enable HolaCDN only during peak hours, between 8pm - 11:30pm<br> <img src="//u3t4s5w8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cdnfaq_match_time.png?md5=4229-381d145a"> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="imp-blockedresources" text="HolaCDN blocked in Google Webmaster Tools"> Why does my Google Webmaster Tools / Google Search Console show that resources originating from the HolaCDN are blocked? </h3> 
    <p> This is by design, and has no effect on your end-user experience, your video performance, or your analytics.<br> The blocked resources report aims to give you insights into which of your resources are blocked from Google's bots that index your site. <br> HolaCDN purposely does not give Google bots access to its servers, in order to avoid duplicate indexing of your content and which could harm SEO rankings of your site. <br> To remove these warnings from your reports, filter out "player.h-cdn.com" from the blocked resources report in your Google Webmaster Tools/Google Search Console. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-purge" text="Purging/blocking videos"> Can I proactively purge specific URLs from HolaCDN servers which are currently caching them? Can I block URLs from being cached? </h3> 
    <p> Yes. You can instantly purge videos from HolaCDN by specifying the offending video URL using the control panel or via an HTTPS based API. You can also block videos from being cached by using the same methods. <br> See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llww0bFiU7pK3thKDm0aUJU38550cLPneBBbEFfEU-0/edit#heading=h.7cu73cqvog1y" target="_blank">implementation guide</a> for details. </p> 
    <h3 id="imp-bugreport" text="Reporting bugs to HolaCDN support"> I think I experienced a bug in HolaCDN - how do I provide more information about it to Hola? </h3> 
    <p> In the developer console, enter hola_cdn.bug_report(). Copy the URL that was generated by the command and send it to HolaCDN support. This sends our support team the full information around the bug that you witnessed, for fast resolution. </p> 
    <h2 id="clientside" text="Client side technology">Client side technology</h2> 
    <h3 id="clientside-whatis" text="What is the HolaCDN client?"> What is the HolaCDN client? Do users need to install anything?</h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN client is lightweight JavaScript code which is part of the web page. Users do not need to install any software or change any settings (there is no need to install Java; <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/java_javascript.xml">JavaScript is not the same as Java)</a>.<br> Users simply play the video, just as they do today. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-whyneeded" text="Why does HolaCDN use a client?"> Why does HolaCDN require a client-side component? My existing CDN doesn't require one... </h3> 
    <p> The JavaScript client creates a client-server video CDN, which is the next generation of CDNs. This is similar to how YouTube and Netflix deliver their content.<br> The client-server approach enables the speed and cost efficiencies that HolaCDN provides. It also monitors the video being played, sending stats to the portal so that you can analyze your users' QoE. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-loadtimes" text="JavaScript load times"> Does the HolaCDN JavaScript affect page load time or performance?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN JavaScript is loaded asynchronously and thus does not slow down the page load time. The JS size is between 150-200KB, depending on required configuration. It is decompressed by the browser to around 750KB. <br> For best results, HolaCDN recommends to place the JS in the head section of the page, but this is not a requirement. It can also be placed at the end of the page. <br> The JS stays cached in the browser, so it is instantly loaded during repeat visits to the website, with no additional network traffic. <br> The algorithm and calculations are very light and do not cause a noticeable increase in CPU utilization or slow down the web page responsiveness in any way. Detailed information regarding load times and CPU utilization are available in the control panel. <br> See the <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/install.md">GitHub page</a> for details. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-isjssafe" text="Can the JS break my page?"> Can the HolaCDN JavaScript break things on my page? What exactly does it change?</h3> 
    <p> No, the HolaCDN Javascript is safe to deploy on your page. <br> HolaCDN does not overwrite any native JS object methods. The JS adds 3 global variables to your page (hola_cdn, hola_player and hola_cdn_require). They are all prefixed. There is no pollution of the global scope. <br> Also, remember that by default, the JS loads in disabled mode, in order to protect from accidental mass-deployment. After you add it to the page, you can gradually enable it from the server side for a small percent of users to test, and increase the scope of deployment after you are comfortable with the results. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-ifjsfail" text="JavaScript load issues"> What if HolaCDN's JavaScript fails to load or loads after the player started playing the video? </h3> 
    <p> Hola's JavaScript module loads asynchronously so that it will never delay the loading of the web page. <br> In rare cases your player will load and start playing the video before the HolaCDN JS is fully loaded. In such cases, the entire video will simply load from your existing CDN. <br> If HolaCDN's JS fails to load for any reason, your video will continue to work as usual, by loading in full from your existing CDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-proxy" text="Is the JavaScript a proxy?"> How does the HolaCDN client side code work with the video player? Is it a proxy? </h3> 
    <p> No, the HolaCDN JavaScript is not an HTTP proxy. The video player sends requests for video segments. These are intercepted by HolaCDN JavaScript, which in turn decides which CDN server to send each request to.<br> Upon receiving back video from the selected server, it sends that data back up to the player. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-content_holaserver" text="Content on HolaCDN servers"> How does the Hola client code know where the content is on the Hola server network? </h3> 
    <p> The client fetches the initial segments from the Hola fast start servers near the client. Meanwhile, the client creates a hash from the URL, which provides the client with a list of servers for fetching the next several segments. These servers then provide the client with information about other servers that hold the same content, so that more sources are available to the client after the initial segments are playing. <br> If the client does not receive a response fast enough from HolaCDN servers, video starts being downloaded from the existing CDN. In parallel, HolaCDN continues to operate and once responses are received, it starts offloading traffic from the existing CDN. <br> In any case, HolaCDN is never a single point of failure. </p> 
    <h3 id="clientside-html5_or_flash" text="HTML5 or Flash player?"> My video player supports both HTML5 and Flash. Which mode is recommended?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN works with both Flash and HTML5 video, but you should use HTML5 where available. Modern HTML5 players offer several advantages over legacy Flash based players: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Full browser support</b>: All modern browsers support HTML5 video. This means that your customers do not need to install any plugins to watch your video. In the case of legacy browsers, most HTML5 players simply fallback to using Flash, so there is no risk in configuring the player to use HTML5 by default. </li> 
     <li> <b>Multi device support:</b> HTML5 video is supported on all modern mobile devices. Flash video is no longer supported on some modern platforms (e.g. SmartTVs and iOS powered devices like iPhone/iPad/AppleTV) </li> 
     <li> <b>Better performance:</b> HTML5 runs faster than Flash and requires less memory. This improved performance means higher user engagement and monetization compared to Flash players. </li> 
     <li> <b>Easier customization and control:</b> HTML5 video players are easy to customize and style to fit your needs using standard web technologies. For example, you can customize player skin and animations using HTML code. </li> 
     <li> <b>Easier HolaCDN integration:</b> HolaCDN integration is just one line of JS code when you use an HTML5 player. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> You can use any HTML5 video player with HolaCDN. If you still use a legacy Flash based player and would like to upgrade to a modern HTML5 video player, check out the <a href="#player">free Hola Player.</a> </p> 
    <h2 id="serverside" text="Server side technology">Server side technology</h2> 
    <h3 id="serverside-dedicated" text="What are HolaCDN servers?"> Do you use your own servers, or rely on a 3rd party provider? What is special about HolaCDN servers? </h3> 
    <p>HolaCDN uses dedicated leased servers in hosting locations worldwide. HolaCDN has two types of servers on its network:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Fast Start servers</b>: High-end servers, used only for first few seconds of the video</li> 
     <li><b>Low cost</b>: Low-cost servers, used to serve the rest of the video</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="serverside-fast_start" text="What are HolaCDN Fast Start servers?"> What are HolaCDN Fast Start servers?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN Fast Servers are used to serve the first few seconds of the video.<br> These are expensive high-end servers, connected via guaranteed high speed bandwidth. In fact, Fast Start servers offer higher performance, and are more expensive than traditional CDN servers. HolaCDN can afford these expensive servers because only the first few seconds of each video are fetched from them, which represents a very small fraction of the overall traffic.<br> Once the video is playing, the client-side JS will start downloading video segments from other, low cost servers on the HolaCDN network. This hybrid approach is unique to HolaCDN and offers the best of both worlds: Fast start times, and low overall delivery cost. </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-servers" text="What are HolaCDN low cost servers?"> What are HolaCDN low cost servers?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN low cost servers, also known as cache servers, are cost effective servers Hola deploys around the globe in cost effective locations.<br> The low cost servers are the main servers used to cache your videos and reduce your CDN cost. The reason HolaCDN can use low-cost servers while actually improving your video user experience and reduce your costs is because of the mid-stream switching technology which allows redundancy, similar to inexpensive hard-drives connected to a RAID controller that create an overall faster and more reliable storage solution. See the analogy: why <a href="#tech-raid">is HolaCDN a lot like a RAID controller?</a> </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-footprint" text="HolaCDN server footprint"> How many Points of Presence (PoPs) do you have? Do you have servers in my country? </h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN deploys thousands of servers in multiple locations. Unlike a traditional CDN, the distance of Hola's CDN server from your users is not important, because the initial seconds of the video are fetched from HolaCDN fast start servers close to your users, and the rest from our various PoPs around the world. See the analogy: why <a href="#tech-raid">is HolaCDN a lot like a RAID controller?</a> In any case, HolaCDN will always use your existing CDN as a fallback and it can only improve performance and reduce costs. </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-footprintchina" text="HolaCDN in China"> Does HolaCDN have servers in China? </h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN currently does not have servers inside China. However, HolaCDN can still reduce costs and improve performance for users inside China. This is because unlike a traditional CDN, the distance of Hola's CDN server from your users is not important. The initial seconds of the video are fetched from a server that is close to your users - most likely from the existing Chinese CDN, and the rest from our various PoPs around the world. See the analogy: why <a href="#tech-raid">is HolaCDN a lot like a RAID controller?</a> In any case, HolaCDN will always use your existing CDN as a fallback and it can only improve performance and reduce costs. </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-capacity" text="HolaCDN capacity"> My site is mostly used in [country XYZ] - what is the maximum capacity HolaCDN can support in this country? </h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN deploys thousands of servers in multiple locations around the globe. Unlike a traditional CDN, the distance of Hola's CDN server from your users is not important, because the initial seconds of the video are fetched from HolaCDN fast start servers close to your users, and the rest from our various PoPs around the world. <br> As a result, when your sites uses HolaCDN, it is effectively connected to <b>global capacity</b>, and not only to capacity offered by servers in your country. Thus, HolaCDN offers greater capacity than traditional, local CDNs. <br> See the analogy: why <a href="#tech-raid">is HolaCDN a lot like a RAID controller?</a> In any case, HolaCDN will always use your existing CDN as a fallback. </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-ifserverfail" text="What if HolaCDN servers fail?"> What happens if HolaCDN servers are not faster than your existing CDN? </h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN client constantly monitors the speed and availability of the HolaCDN servers. If the performance of the HolaCDN server being used to stream the video is not fast enough for a steady stream, the HolaCDN client will instantly switch to another server (using Hola's <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a> technology), with the following logic: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> The HolaCDN client first tries to find another HolaCDN server that can stream the video. If one or more servers are available, the HolaCDN client selects the best server and starts streaming video from it. </li> 
     <li> If the HolaCDN client cannot find a suitable HolaCDN server, it switches to the existing CDN(s), and video is streamed from the original CDN(s) with no interruption. </li> 
     <li> While video is streamed from the existing CDN(s), the HolaCDN client continues looking for available HolaCDN servers that can stream the video. If/when a suitable HolaCDN server is found, the HolaCDN client will switch to that server. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> <br> In any case, HolaCDN can only <a href="#howitworks">improve the reliability</a> of your video delivery. Videos will stream without interruption - either from one or more HolaCDN servers, or from your existing CDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-prewarm" text="Do I need to pre-warm caches?"> Do I need to push content to HolaCDN to 'pre-warm' the caches? </h3> 
    <p> No. You do not have to upload content to HolaCDN to 'warm the cache'. <br> HolaCDN uses a 'pull' method to fetch the first copy of every video from your existing CDN. <br> The first user who watches a video is served from your existing CDN, and in parallel triggers HolaCDN to fetch a copy of the video from your existing CDN. <br> HolaCDN uses several methods to <a href="#tech-overhead">minimize the load on your existing CDN.</a> </p> 
    <h3 id="serverside-storagepay" text="Do I need to pay for storage?"> Do I need to pay for video storage on HolaCDN servers? </h3> 
    <p> No. You do not need to pay for storage of your videos on HolaCDN. </p> 
    <h2 id="statistics" text="Analytics">The Analytics dashboard</h2> 
    <h3 id="statistics-what" text="What is it?"> What is the Hola User QoE Analytics dashboard?</h3> 
    <p> Once the HolaCDN client JavaScript is on your video's web page, you have access to the viewing experience analytics dashboard, which provides you with all the key parameters of your customers' viewing experience. The dashboard lets you slice the data by geography, browser, operating system and device. All of the statistics are available on a per-CDN basis, allowing you to easily compare performance metrics between the various CDNs that you use. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//a6z6y7e8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cdnfaq_analytics_dashboard.png?md5=38520-46f756ab"> 
    <h3 id="statistics-free" text="Why are statistics free?"> Why do we provide free analytics?</h3> 
    <p> While other companies charge monthly fees for similar products, we believe that the best way to show off the value of the HolaCDN is to first show what your existing performance is, and then to let you compare it with what we can do for you. Enjoy! </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-howtoimplement" text="Implementing QoE Analytics"> How do I implement the QoE Analytics dashboard in to my video site?</h3> 
    <p>Sign up on <a href="/">holacdn.com</a>, and you will receive an email with implementation instructions.</p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-only_stats" text="Use only free statistics"> Can I use the QoE Analytics dashboard without paying for HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p>Yes.</p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-compare" text="Comparing my CDN to HolaCDN"> Can HolaCDN provide some traffic in order to compare user experience between my CDN(s) and HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. By default, HolaCDN team will enable HolaCDN servers to stream some of your video traffic. This will reduce your existing CDN traffic and cost, and it is free of charge.<br> You do not need to take any action to receive this traffic. If you are using HolaCDN video analytics and do not want to receive free traffic, <a href="mailto:support@holaspark.com">contact us</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-neutrality" text="HolaCDN statistics neutrality"> How can I be sure that HolaCDN analytics are neutral (i.e. do not artificially favor HolaCDN)?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN compares your native CDN's performance to the HolaCDN streaming performance. You can verify that HolaCDN's video analytics are correctly measured, by following these steps: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Create a test zone</b>: Choose a URL (e.g. http://mysite.com/videos/21058) you would like to test on, and create a new, separate test zone in your <a href="/cp/conf">control panel configuration section</a>. Enter the URL in the 'Page Match' filter when creating the test zone, in order to associate that specific URL to the test zone. This will isolate your manual testing results from other video analytics collected. </li> 
     <li> <b>Test videos delivered only by your existing CDN</b>: Append '?hola_mode=stats' to your URL (e.g. http://mysite.com/videos/21058?hola_mode=stats) and play the video several times. Clear the browser cache between tests. Measure the start time, seek time and other performance you want using a stopwatch and record the results. For additional ways to control HolaCDN, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llww0bFiU7pK3thKDm0aUJU38550cLPneBBbEFfEU-0/edit#heading=h.f4vn2b2fmo28">the step-by-step guide.</a><br> Make sure you either play the video all the way until the end, or navigate to another page when you finish each video play - this will ensure the report is sent to the server. </li> 
     <li> <b>Test videos delivered when streaming from HolaCDN servers is enabled:</b> Repeat the same tests, but to enable traffic from HolaCDN servers, append '?hola_mode=cdn' to your URL (e.g. http://mysite.com/videos/21058?hola_mode=cdn). Again, play the video a few times. Clear the browser cache between tests, measure and record the results. </li> 
     <li> <b>Check the results on the HolaCDN control panel</b>: On the HolaCDN control panel, go to <a href="/cp/stats">your account</a> and filter by the test zone you created earlier.<br> You will see your results for each set of tests in its corresponding column. Verify the number of reports collected corresponds to the number of videos you played, and then compare results to the average results you recorded using your stopwatch.<br> Note that the HolaCDN control panel performs aggregation calculations every 5 minutes, so it may take some time for results to appear. You will most likely see yellow warning triangles - this is normal and expected, since your manual testing probably did not generate enough samples to be statistically significant.<br> If you still have questions, <a href="/#contact">Contact HolaCDN support</a>. </li>

    <p> HolaCDN only collects information regarding video performance: start/seek times, buffering events, video bitrates etc.<br> All statistics are available as tables and graphs per platform, per device, per country, per city, and per ISP and are exportable to multiple formats.<br> For a more detailed list see our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIqjml7yA-zcVIWcD7I17UdfqGBTMms5iSVgIAGSMwg/edit?usp=sharing">reference guide</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-personal_data" text="Is personal data collected?"> Do you collect any personal information?</h3> 
    <p> No. HolaCDN does not collect any personally identifiable information such as usernames and passwords. It only collects video performance information such as start time, seek time, and buffering events.<br> Information collected is sent as clear text and can be seen in the browser developer console. Detailed sample printouts of the information collected are available in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GIqjml7yA-zcVIWcD7I17UdfqGBTMms5iSVgIAGSMwg/edit?usp=sharing">reference guide</a>. Data collected is stored on secure, dedicated HolaCDN servers. <br> If you want to reduce information collected even further, see below. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-scrub_ip" text="German privacy laws"> German laws consider IP addresses as personal information. Can HolaCDN comply?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. If you would not like IP address information to be stored on HolaCDN servers, you can simply turn on the "Enhanced user privacy" setting in the configuration section. This will strip away any user identifiers such as IP addresses from logs and error reports. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-demo" text="Demo account"> Do you have a demo account I can use to view live statistics?</h3> 
    <p> Yes, in order to see a live portal account, click 'live dashboard' on <a href="/#dashboard">HolaCDN Video Analytics section</a> of the website. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-multi_user" text="Multiple user accounts"> Do you support multiple users on one portal account?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. Additional users from the same company can easily be added to the same account. <a href="/#contact">Contact HolaCDN support</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-granular" text="Data granularity"> How granular are HolaCDN statistics?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN statistics are stored for each video in one second increments. Aggregation calculations are performed every 5 minutes. Raw data can be exported to JSON and CSV formats, and via API to external platform. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-rawdata" text="Raw data API"> Is there an API to export user experience data into my systems for analysis? </h3> 
    <p> Yes. Detailed statistics are exportable as JSON events from the control panel via API. For even more granular data, raw data collected by HolaCDN JS clients can be uploaded into your databases. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-peruser" text="Data per user session"> Can I get data for a specific user session - for example, a single video play history? </h3> 
    <p>Yes, this information can be retrieved from the raw data that you can upload into your databases.</p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-rawlogs" text="Raw data logs"> Can I access raw data showing bandwidth used for specific video file, or by specific IPs? </h3> 
    <p> Yes, you can use an API to download raw data over HTTPS. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1llww0bFiU7pK3thKDm0aUJU38550cLPneBBbEFfEU-0/edit#heading=h.382ebzesxb26" target="_blank">implementation guide</a> for details. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-retention" text="Data retention"> How long are statistics are kept for in HolaCDN portal?</h3> 
    <p> If your account is active, HolaCDN does not delete video analytics from your account, but the granularity of stored statistics varies.<br> Granular statistics (which go down to 5 minute intervals) are available for a period of 30 days. <br> Statistics 30 days or older are averaged (to hour, and later into days intervals). <br> So, last week's data includes all data points and the results are very detailed, but last month's data is less detailed. <br> <strong>Note:</strong>If your account is inactive for over 90 days (meaning: HolaCDN was not used to stream videos or collect video analytics), it will be automatically disabled. Billing records will remain intact, but all statistics in your account will be permanently deleted. <br> You may re-activate your account at any time by logging in to the portal. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-updatefrequency" text="Update frequency"> How fast does it take for statistics to appear in the HolaCDN portal?</h3> 
    <p> Statistics for individual videos appear in the 'events' table as soon as the video finishes playing.<br> Statistics from multiple videos are aggregated every 5 minutes, which is also the frequency the dashboard, maps and detailed statistics table are updated. </p> 
    <h3 id="statistics-alerts" text="Monitoring &amp; alerts"> Can I set limits on parameters and get alerts when they are exceeded?</h3> 
    <p>Yes. Alerts are available for key parameters and are sent via email.</p> 
    <h2 id="multicdn" text="MultiCDN">MultiCDN</h2> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-managing" text="Managing Multiple CDNs"> How does HolaCDN help me manage multiple CDNs?</h3> 
    <p> Simply add a single line of JavaScript to your video web page, define the multiple CDNs you are currently using, and that's it! HolaCDN will automatically measure performance of your different CDNs and select the optimal CDN to use. <br> Note that HolaCDN only handles your video traffic. There is no need to change DNS settings or any of the other changes usually required when implementing multiple traditional CDNs. HolaCDN does not require you to make any changes to your existing CDN infrastructure. </p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-difference" text="Difference from existing solutions"> How is HolaCDN's MultiCDN feature different from existing solutions? Why is it better? </h3> 
    <p>Existing MultiCDN solutions:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Rely on networking parameters</b>: Only simple networking information like ping/latency, throughput, jitter is collected. This information is loosely related to what users are experiencing when they watch the video. </li> 
     <li> <b>Centralized decision by a server</b>: Data collected by clients is uploaded to a centralized server which sends decisions back to other clients. </li> 
     <li> <b>Server uses historical data for decisions</b>: The server estimates what will be the best CDN choice for the next user, using historical data from other users. </li> 
     <li> <b>Decisions based on heuristics</b>: The server uses the historical data combined with heuristics to estimate what the QoE will be for the next user. </li> 
     <li> <b>One, final decision per video</b>: The centralized server instructs the user to load a manifest pointing to CDN X or CDN Y. Thus the MultiCDN decision is final for the duration of the video. The user will only fetch video chunks from the selected CDN. </li> 
     <li> <b>Streaming is limited to traditional CDNs</b>: Video is streamed from a single server which is close to the user. This server might be overloaded during peak times, since all users in the region are redirected to it. Also, the closest server might be more expensive than servers in other locations which are capable of streaming the video at comparable quality. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> In Contrast, HolaCDN: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Relies on real user QoE metrics</b>: HolaCDN measures actual user QoE (e.g. start time, buffering rates, frames per second...) - exactly what users are experiencing as they watch the video. </li> 
     <li> <b>Distributed, client-based decisions</b>: Each HolaCDN client uses the real-time QoE data it collects for the specific user to select the best CDN for that user. No centralized servers are used. </li> 
     <li> <b>Decisions based on real-time data</b>: Since real-time QoE data is available, the HolaCDN client does not need to rely on heuristics. Since the client measures QoE, it has a very short feedback loop and can optimize its decisions in real-time. </li> 
     <li> <b>Multiple real-time decisions per video</b>: The HolaCDN client continuously monitors the user QoE and selects the best CDN for every video chunk, not for the entire video. The user will fetch video chunks from as many CDNs as needed (X,Y, HolaCDN...) during the video play to ensure excellent QoE. </li> 
     <li> <b>Streaming not limited to traditional CDNs</b>: The HolaCDN client performs <a href="#tech-switching">mid-stream switching</a> to optimize for cost and quality. <br> Video is initially streamed from the closest/fastest server - usually from a HolaCDN <a href="#serverside-fast_start">fast start server</a>. Once it is safe to do so, video is streamed from one or more HolaCDN <a href="#serverside-servers">low cost servers</a> that can provide optimal quality. This results in reduced delivery costs with same or better performance compared to traditional CDNs. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <p> HolaCDN's real-time, client based approach to MultiCDN provides more accurate results and delivers better performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-price" text="How much does it cost?"> How much does HolaCDN's MultiCDN switching feature cost?</h3> 
    <p> MultiCDN switching is free. If you add HolaCDN as one of the CDNs to choose from, you will only pay for traffic coming from HolaCDN servers. </p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-sources" text="Do I have to use HolaCDN?"> Can I use MultiCDN switching only on my existing CDNs or do I have to use HolaCDN servers? </h3> 
    <p> You do not have to use HolaCDN for traffic. You can use Multi-CDN switching on your existing CDNs. HolaCDN can be added as one of the CDNs via simple configuration on the portal. </p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-workflows" text="Do I need to Change workflows?"> Do I need to change workflows (e.g. publish content to HolaCDN)? </h3> 
    <p> No. Since HolaCDN <a href="#serverside-prewarm">uses a 'pull' model</a> to fetch the first copy from your existing CDN, you do not need to change any of your publishing workflows or procedures. </p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-operation" text="Operation modes"> How does HolaCDN select the right CDN for my video?</h3> 
    <p>MultiCDN switching has 3 modes of operation:</p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>Dynamic mode</b>: The user sets the cost per GB of each CDN, and the HolaCDN JS client dynamically decides where to send traffic to. The switching decision is calculated every 100ms, and is optimal per each end-user. When the video starts, the JS client will select the fastest available source, irrespective of cost. Once the video is playing and a sufficient buffer is available, the JS client will select the lowest cost video source which will ensure smooth viewing experience with no buffering. In case the probability of buffering increases, the JS client will revert to one of the faster CDNs, irrespective of cost. </li> 
     <li> <b>Static mode</b>: CDNs are selected based on static rules configured by the user. Every CDN is assigned a percent of traffic to receive from the overall traffic. It is also possible to allocate CDN per geographical area, time and URL matches. </li> 
     <li><b>Disabled mode</b>: HolaCDN does not change any CDN selection currently in place. It only collects performance statistics for each CDN.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-statistics" text="MultiCDN statistics"> I use multiple CDNs to serve my videos. Can I use Hola statistics to measure and compare performance between several CDNs? </h3> 
    <p>Yes, you can easily compare performance of multiple CDNs as part of the free statistics.</p> 
    <h3 id="multicdn-algorithm" text="Algorithm description"> How exactly does the MultiCDN algorithm decide where to stream video from? </h3> 
    <p> A detailed step by step description of the MultiCDN algorithm is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KzS4mIQGGHfUKie4LsXmTGdcmgkMfcIf-w_lDTbVZ2M/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a> </p>

    <h2 id="bwsaver" text="Bandwidth saver">Bandwidth saver</h2> 
    <h3 id="bwsaver-where" text="How much does it cost?"> How much does the bandwidth saver feature cost?</h3> 
    <p> The bandwidth saver is provided for free as part of HolaCDN. In fact, since it reduces total bandwidth consumption, it actually reduces the effective price of HolaCDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="bwsaver-formats" text="Supported formats"> What file formats are supported?</h3> 
    <p> The bandwidth saver supports only progressive download of MP4/FLV/WebM video files.<br> The bandwidth saver does not work with segmented protocols such as HLS/HDS/DASH - these protocols have built-in mechanisms to save bandwidth. </p> 
    <h3 id="bwsaver-work" text="How does it work?">How does it work?</h3> 
    <p>The bandwidth saver prevents excessive downloading of video which might not be viewed by the user. It requests large video files in small segments and reduces bandwidth usage by 30-40%.</p> 
    <h3 id="bwsaver-measuring" text="Measuring performance"> How will I know if the bandwidth saver is working?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN provides you with a free video analytics portal, detailed insights, reports and quality of service metrics to track, measure and monitor your streams. You can see your bandwidth savings in the portal - see the example below. </p> 
    <h3 id="bwsaver-how_much" text="How much will I save?"> How much bandwidth will I save?</h3> 
    <p>Typically, between 30-40%. Results will differ based on the duration of your videos, viewing habits, connection speeds, players etc.</p>

    <h3 id="commercial-savings" text="Cost savings"> How much money will I save with HolaCDN compared to my existing CDN?</h3> 
    <p> A lot! The exact percentage depends on how much you are paying to your existing CDN provider today. Our pricing is simple and transparent, with no minimums or commitments. As a rule of thumb, expect HolaCDN to offload 90% or more of your video traffic from your existing CDN. This means that if your existing CDN costs more than 1 cent/GB in any geography, any traffic offloaded to HolaCDN will save you the difference.<br> In addition to a low per-GB price, HolaCDN also reduces the actual bandwidth consumption, see below. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//s2c2w8t4.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/cost_savings.png?md5=50719-b724b11c"> 
    <h3 id="commercial-bwsavings" text="Bandiwdth savings"> Will using HolaCDN reduce my actual bandwidth consumption?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN reduces your traffic consumption using different algorithms. </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Progressive downloads</b>: Typically MP4/WebM files. 
      <ul> 
       <li> <b>The problem</b>: Streaming large MP4 files is often inefficient, because the MP4 is downloaded in full even if only a small part of it is viewed. This results in wasted bandwidth and increased costs. </li> 
       <li> <b>The solution</b>: The HolaCDN bandwidth saver downloads only the parts of the video which are required for viewing, while monitoring the video players buffer size in order to ensure uninterrupted viewing.<br> This feature typically reduces bandwidth consumption by 30-40%. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
     <li> <b>Adaptive protocols</b>: Typically HLS/HDS/Dash protocols. 
      <ul> 
       <li> <b>The problem</b>: In many cases, especially when the user has a fast connection, their video player might stream video at quality profiles which are larger than the player's actual size in pixels. This not only increases delivery costs, it also increases probability of buffering and playback issues due to CPU cycles required to downscale the large video files to fit the small player window. </li> 
       <li> <b>The solution</b>: The HolaCDN client monitors the size of the video player, and makes sure that video in resolutions larger than the player size is not requested, since there is no benefit in streaming these higher resolutions.<br> This feature typically reduces bandwidth consumption by 20-30%. </li> 
      </ul> </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="commercial-bwresolution" text="Smart adaptive streaming"> How does the HolaCDN algorithm save bandwidth for HLS video?</h3> 
    <p> Video players are implemented using different sizes, according to the design of the web page. When the user watches video on a player with small window size (e.g 400*300 pixels), there is no point in streaming very high-resolution video (e.g. 1920*1080 pixels). This is because the large video is simply reduced back to fit the small player size, which loads the CPU, but offers no visible quality improvement. Furthermore, streaming high-quality video increases cost and likelihood of performance issues such as buffering. <br> The HolaCDN client side code optimizes video for the best viewing experience, without compromising quality. The user always gets the highest resolution viewable on their player. <br> The algorithm works as follows: Depending on available bandwidth, it selects video resolutions that are either smaller or slightly bigger of the target player resolution. For example, when playing the video on a small player (400x300 pixels), it will choose the closest resolution available (e.g. 480*320) but not higher resolutions. If the user switches to full-screen, the HolaCDN client will detect this and change the maximum resolution to 1920*1080, for example. <br> In any case, the HolaCDN client will never select a video bitrate that is higher than 1.2x the currently available bandwidth - this is to avoid buffering due to insufficient bandwidth. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-pricing" text="HolaCDN Pricing"> How much does HolaCDN cost, and what is the pricing model?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN uses as "Pay As You Go" model with a flat price of 1¢ per GB. You only pay for bytes downloaded from HolaCDN. There is no setup fee, no minimum commitment and no binding contract. HolaCDN is significantly more affordable than traditional CDNs, while providing better performance. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-https" text="HTTP/HTTPS pricing"> Are prices the same for HTTP and for HTTPS videos?</h3> 
    <p>Yes.</p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-origintraffic" text="Traffic from origin"> Does HolaCDN charge for incoming traffic from the existing CDN?</h3> 
    <p>No. HolaCDN only charges for traffic flowing from HolaCDN servers to your users.</p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-intraholatraffic" text="Traffic between HolaCDN servers"> Does HolaCDN charge for traffic between different HolaCDN servers?</h3> 
    <p>No. HolaCDN only charges for traffic flowing from HolaCDN servers to your users.</p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-worldwide_priving" text="Worldwide pricing"> Are HolaCDN prices different in different countries?</h3> 
    <p> No. HolaCDN uses a technology that is radically different compared to traditional CDNs. Video on HolaCDN can be served from any country to any country. As a result, HolaCDN is priced the same for all countries. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-evalperiod" text="Free evaluation"> Do you offer a free evaluation period? Do I need to enter a credit card?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN offers a 7-day trial period that allows you to send unlimited traffic, and you don't even need a credit card to get started.<br> You only need to go to holacdn.com and click the "Start Now" button, to open the dialog box used for signing up. After you fill-in your email address and password and click "Create account", a verification email is sent to the address you specified. Clicking the link contained in this message directs you to your HolaCDN account control panel, where your customer ID is displayed on the upper left corner.<br> During the evaluation period, video analytics are collected for all platforms, but HolaCDN traffic can only be enabled on Chrome browsers.<br> The 7-day period only begins on the day you start using HolaCDN to send traffic to your users. <br> At the end of the 7-day period, you may either activate your account by entering payment details, or continue using free features such as video, QoE statistics, and MultiCDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-payment" text="how to pay">How do I pay for HolaCDN?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN uses a simple prepayment model, similar to services like SkypeOut. To purchase traffic on HolaCDN, visit your account page and buy bandwidth credits.<br> The minimum payment for HolaCDN is $100.<br> An invoice will be sent to your account's email address.<br> With every 1GB traffic used, your account credit will be reduced by 1¢. Once your credit level drops below 15% of your balance, a notification will be sent, reminding you to add bandwidth credits to your account.<br> When your balance reaches zero, HolaCDN servers will no longer send traffic to your users. All video will be downloaded from your original video source(s). Statistics collection will continue, because statistics are free.<br> Credits in your account do not expire, and any unused credits are rolled over to the next month. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-paymentmethods" text="payment method">What are the accepted payment methods?</h3> 
    <p>HolaCDN accepts credit cards, PayPal and wire transfers.</p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-lessexpensive" text="HolaCDN is expensive"> I think my existing CDN is cheaper than HolaCDN. Can I still benefit from HolaCDN? </h3> 
    <p> Yes. Enter your costs in the control panel, and HolaCDN will only kick-in if your existing CDN underperforms. HolaCDN will monitor the health of the video stream in real-time, and if there is risk of buffering, it will be activated, ensuring that end-user performance remains acceptable. You will only be billed for traffic sent by HolaCDN servers during these periods, with no minimum or commitment. See the screenshot below: </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//a6z6y7e8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/multi_selection.png?md5=19387-ebc426d6"> 
    <h3 id="commercial-precommitment" text="Precommittment to existing CDN"> How can I use HolaCDN if I already have a pre-commitment with my existing CDN? </h3> 
    <p> You can enjoy the benefits of HolaCDN even if you have a pre-commitment with your existing CDN. Configure HolaCDN to be more expensive than your CDN, even if it is not. User experience statistics are 100% free; and HolaCDN can kick in automatically as performance booster when your existing CDN performs poorly.<br> You can tune HolaCDN so that your pre-committed traffic will be used in full, and any traffic over the precommit will be handled by HolaCDN at reduced rates. As you exceed your precommit level, change the cost back so that HolaCDN is cheaper than your CDN, and HolaCDN will start offloading traffic.<br> Once the pre-commitment period is up, many customers significantly reduce the pre-commitment to the existing CDN, which allows them to extend their savings and performance improvements. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-support" text="Technical support"> Does HolaCDN offer technical support? Do you have 24x7 support?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN offers support via <a href="/#contact">mail, WhatsApp, phone and Skype</a>. In addition, customers have access to 24x7 support, which is provided by Hola engineers manning our Network Operations Center (NOC). </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-sitemonitor" text="HolaCDN 24x7 NOC"> How can HolaCDN help me improve my site's overall reliability?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN operates a 24x7 Network Operations Center (NOC), monitored by Hola engineers. The NOC team uses automated systems to monitor your site's health, and is trained to perform manual tests to identify and troubleshoot problems. Monitoring is performed on three levels: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li> <b>HolaCDN performance monitoring</b>: HolaCDN provides numerous performance metrics, which the NOC team monitors in order to verify that HolaCDN operates as expected on your site. For example, the team will verify that HolaCDN offloads traffic from your existing CDN, and that user performance is always same or better compared to your existing CDN. </li> 
     <li> <b>Existing CDN monitoring</b>: Every HolaCDN deployment leaves a small fraction of traffic running on your existing CDN and measures its performance. This allows HolaCDN to have an ongoing A/B test to verify that HolaCDN improves performance. An important side benefit of this approach is that the NOC team uses these metrics to monitor your existing CDN's performance. For example, if your existing CDN is slow or unavailable, the team will be notified.<br> If you opted to use the <a href="#commercial-hotline">Hotline service</a>, the team can alert you to problem with your existing CDN, and offer assistance. </li> 
     <li> <b>Website health monitoring</b>: In case of problems with your own site, the NOC team receives automated alerts and will check the nature of reported problems. For example, your site might publish some broken links, or a 3rd party plug-in (e.g. advertising) you use might break. Although these issues are unrelated to CDN, they can still have a negative impact on your users' experience.<br> If you opted to use the <a href="#commercial-hotline">Hotline service</a>, the team can alert you to problem with regarding problems on your site, and offer assistance. </li> 
    </ul> 
    <h3 id="commercial-selenium" text="Automated testing"> How does HolaCDN monitor my video's health? What kind of tests are performed?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN customers enjoy 24x7 monitoring of their sites. Videos on your site undergo comprehensive automated testing every 15 minutes as follows: </p> 
    <ul> 
     <li><b>Video types and formats</b>: 
      <ul> 
       <li>Formats: progressive and adaptive video</li> 
       <li>VoD: long and short video</li> 
       <li>Live: live video streams </li>

    <p> If one of the tests fails, the NOC team receives an automated alert and will check the nature of reported problem. If you opted to use the <a href="#commercial-hotline">Hotline service</a>, the team will alert you with a detailed description of the issue by phone and/or email.<br> For example, HolaCDN NOC might notify you that on a specific part of your site, video ads are not loading, or that videos freeze after 10 seconds when playing on Android.<br> Coming soon: Current and historical site test results will be available on your HolaCDN control panel, and you will receive automated alerts if one or more of the tests fail. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-hotline" text="24x7 Hotline service"> Do you offer a monitoring service? If so, how much does it cost?</h3> 
    <p> Yes. HolaCDN offers a "Hotline" service, which allows you to be notified in case of problems on your site or on your existing CDN.<br> You can receive alerts via phone or email. To enter your contact details and specify times of day HolaCDN is allowed to contact you, go to your portal account and enter the relevant information.<br> HolaCDN support team focuses on video related issues. The Hotline service is offered as a courtesy and should not be used as a replacement to full site monitoring.<br> The Hotline service is provided free of charge to HolaCDN customers. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-sla" text="Is there an SLA?"> Does HolaCDN offer an SLA?</h3> 
    <p> HolaCDN is an overlay to your existing CDN. It offloads video whenever possible in order to reduce costs and improve performance. In case HolaCDN is slow or unavailable for any reason, traffic will simply be reverted to your existing CDN. HolaCDN is never a single point of failure.<br> You can test this yourself by playing with the <a href="/">online demo</a>. Play the video, and proceed to disable all the HolaCDN servers. You will see that video continues to be downloaded, from the existing original CDN (in red), with no interruption.<br> In addition to the built-in failover mechanisms, HolaCDN performs <a href="#commercial-sitemonitor"> 24x7 monitoring</a> to check the health of your site.<br> Thus, with HolaCDN, the overall reliability of your video delivery and of your site in general is same or better than without HolaCDN.<br> As a result, HolaCDN does not offer an SLA, but is provided as an 'as-is' service. You can see additional details in the <a href="/license">license agreement</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-refund" text="Refund policy"> What is HolaCDN's refund policy?</h3> 
    <p> The cancellation terms are as defined in the <a href="/license">license agreement</a>.<br> HolaCDN service is provided as-is. There are no refunds. </p> 
    <h3 id="commercial-websiteblock" text="Holacdn site is blocked"> I cannot access holacdn.com from my office network, but it works from my home PC and mobile browsers. How can this be?</h3> 
    <p> Some companies use 3rd party security firewalls or proxies which are designed to block access to domains that fall into certain categories (e.g. adult content, gambling). In some cases, these 3rd party solutions incorrectly categorize legitimate sites and block them. The security industry calls these cases 'False Positives' and actively tries to eliminate them, as they harm, rather than help, their customers.<br> If holacdn.com works normally from locations other than your office, it is possible that holacdn.com is categorized incorrectly by your company's security solution and as such is a false positive.<br> In this case, please <a href="/#contact">contact us</a> with the name of the offending firewall. HolaCDN support will contact the vendor and remove the false positive. Your security device will receive an automatic update from the security vendor and the block will disappear. This process usually takes a few days.<br> Note that such false positives only impact your ability to browse to holacdn.com. They do not impact the functionality of HolaCDN's ongoing service in any way. </p> 
    <h2 id="demo" text="Demo extension">Demo extension</h2> 
    <p><a href="http://j.mp/HolaDemoExt">Install extension</a></p> 
    <h3 id="demo-overview" text="Demo extension overview"> What is the HolaCDN demo extension?</h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN demo Chrome extension is a tool that can be used for demonstrating HolaCDN in action on an existing website, with no integration effort.<br> The demo extension is not guaranteed to work on all websites or videos. It is possible, for example, that the extension will fail to find the video player on the page, or that the video player included in the page is not supported.<br> You should also be aware that the extension demonstrates the performance of a "cold cache" system, namely: a system where the requested video was not yet saved to cache and is being played by using a physical read from the disk. This is because you, as the extension user, are the first and only user of the video on your website page! As a result, the performance you witness is far from the one provided by a "warm cache" system, where videos are pre-cached on multiple servers.<br> Therefore, the HolaCDN demo Chrome extension should only be used for demonstrating HolaCDN's seamless integration and ease of use, and not for performance purposes. With that in mind, you are welcome to download the demo extension <a href="http://j.mp/HolaDemoExt">here</a>. </p> 
    <h3 id="demo-work" text="How does it work?">How does it work?</h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN extension works by adding the HolaCDN JavaScript locally into the browser page, thereby effectively simulating a real life deployment, where the JavaScript is coming from the servers as part of the web page. The extension locates the video player on the page, temporarily replaces it with Hola video player, and reloads the video that will start playing by using HolaCDN. The extension also provides a graphical overlay on top of the video, which shows HolaCDN performance and % of traffic retrieved from the existing CDN and from HolaCDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="demo-using" text="Using the demo extension"> How do I use the demo extension?</h3> 
    <p> Go to a web page with video. Play the video, and then click the HolaCDN extension button. You will see that the code is being injected into the web page. When the process is complete, press play and HolaCDN should work. Note: Sometimes, you may need to pause the original video before clicking the HolaCDN extension in order to avoid 2 videos playing at the same time. Also, in case the extension cannot replace the video player in the exact location, it will open as a floating frame on top of the web page. This is normal.<br> The extension is updated automatically every time a new version becomes available on the Chrome store. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//s2c2w8t4.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/extension1.png?md5=382424-74e82a6a"> 
    <h3 id="demo-detailed" text="Detailed statistics screen"> What can I learn from the Detailed Statistics screen?</h3> 
    <p> The Detailed Statistics screen provides additional information that can help demonstrate how HolaCDN works. It contains the list of active servers for the current video, as well as their location, throughput, and latency. The video player buffer is also shown. All statistics are updated in real time.<br> <br> Look at the player buffer as it goes up and down. You will see that it usually remains above 15 seconds. This 'safe zone' allows HolaCDN servers which are *not* the fastest and do *not* have the best latency to deliver video without harming user experience.<br> <br> Experiment with the switches; Disable the active HolaCDN server, and see how traffic is shifted to other HolaCDN servers.<br> Disable all HolaCDN servers, and see the graceful fallback to the original CDN. This will show you how HolaCDN is not a single point of failure.<br> Lastly, experiment with disabling your own CDN server. You will see that video will continue playing from different HolaCDN servers. This shows how HolaCDN can actually increase the overall reliability of your system; if one of your servers or CDN underperforms or goes down, HolaCDN will ensure video continues streaming. </p> 
    <h3 id="demo-savings" text="Cost savings calculator"> What is the cost savings calculator, and how do I use it?</h3> 
    <p> The cost savings calculator provides a quick estimate of the cost savings that HolaCDN can deliver. Enter your cost per GB in the box, making sure that you entered the blended worldwide costs. As the video starts playing, you will see the estimated savings.<br> <br> Note that the savings calculator is only able to provide an estimate. Your actual results will vary. For example, if your typical video duration is longer than the video you are using with the demo extension, your savings will be considerably higher. As a rule of thumb, expect HolaCDN to offload 90% or more of your video traffic from your existing CDN. </p> 
    <h3 id="demo-reporting" text="Reporting problems"> The demo extension didn't work correctly. What next?</h3> 
    <p> Send an email to <a href="mailto:success@holaspark.com">success@holaspark.com</a> with the exact URL where you tried the extension and a few words about the problem you saw. An engineer will try to fix the problem and inform you when the fix is available. Note: it is possible that the extension will not be able to work on some sites. </p> 
    <h3 id="demo-sim" text="HolaCDN extension simulation mode"> Why does "Simulation mode" show up when I use the HolaCDN demo extension on my site? </h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN extension is a quick way to see the benefits of HolaCDN on your site, but it does not fully replicate a complete HolaCDN integration. The 'Simulation mode' alert means the video played is protected using a method which prevents HolaCDN servers from downloading the first copy of the video in order to serve it to users. To see a real simulation of HolaCDN using the extension, try another video on your site which is not protected. For example, videos of full episodes are often protected, but short clips/trailers are not. Content protection is easy to handle when doing a full HolaCDN deployment. For additional information visit <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/install.md#5-handling-content-protection">the GitHub page</a>. </p> 
    <h2 id="integration" text="Integration wizard">Integration wizard</h2> 
    <h3 id="integration-overview" text="Integration overview"> What is the HolaCDN integration wizard?</h3> 
    <p> The HolaCDN integration wizard is a tool that can be used for testing a web page with HolaCDN and to present its test results. </p> 
    <img class="ext_img" src="//a6z6y7e8.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/www/cdn/pub/img/int_wizard.png?md5=66495-579e23fa"> 
    <h3 id="integration-using" text="Using the integration wizard"> How do I use the integration wizard?</h3> 
    <p> Go to the integration wizard, paste your URL web page, click on the test button, and verify the results. </p> 
    <h3 id="integration-results" text="Integration results"> What can I learn from the integration test results?</h3> 
    <p> The integration test results help verify that a web page with HolaCDN works. See the <a href="#imp">Starting to use HolaCDN section</a> and our <a href="https://github.com/hola/cdn/blob/master/CORS.md">CORS config page</a> for additional details. </p>
