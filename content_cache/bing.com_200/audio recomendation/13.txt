           <blockquote> 
            <p>This document outlines recommended UI changes resulting from the Projects Usability Study. In the present form the recommendations are draft and intended as a starting point for discussion among the interested parties (Java, Web Apps, EE, ME, etc). </p> 
            <p>The priority rankings:</p> 
            <p>P1 = Must be done for a usable projects release</p> 
            <p>P2 = Should be done for a usable projects release</p> 
            <p>P3 = Nice to have done for a usable projects release</p> 
            <p>The priorities only apply to issues discovered during the usability study. Other issues may merit consideration but are not covered by this document.</p>

            <p>For more information about the problems these recommendations address, please see the <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/usability/April_21_03/JavaProjectReport.html">Usability Report</a>.</p> 
            <h3><a name="explorer"></a>Project Explorer (Active Project, Node Order, Node Names)</h3> 
            <blockquote> 
             <p>Bugs: <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33603">33603</a>, <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33604">33604</a></p> 
             <p>Priority: P1</p> 
             <p>The Project Explorer needs some changes to clarify the content of a project along with the Active project. To address these issues the following recommendations are made:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Remove Output and Resources nodes:</strong> Removing the output and resources nodes (placing their functionality into the project customizer below) will simplify the explorer tree.</li> 
              <li><strong>Divide the display of the project into a Logical Tab and a Files Tab:</strong> By splitting the views up it should clear up confusion that may result from having items appear twice under the same tree as is the case now. The files tab also provides a better place to work with vcs commands on the project contents.</li> 
              <li><strong>Change the way Active project is indicated and used (Infrastructure):</strong> Bold the title of the Active project in the Project Explorer; add a checkbox to the new project wizard to set the newly created project active (default is true. see new wizard section); make the Set Active popup menu item more visible.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>Three things should help confer the importance of the Active project in the IDE: 1. better indication in the explorer; 2. a prominent option in all project wizards and open dialogs to set the new or opened project as Active; 3. more prominent location of the Set Active action in the project pop-up menu. A different term may help as well though it is not clear what that might be.</p> 
             <p>Along with better indication of the Active state, a project should automatically become active after it has been created (from the wizard) or opened. A check box in the wizard and in the filechooser for opening a project will let the user decide if they want the new/selected project to become active -by default this is set to true.</p> 
             <h4>Infrastructure UI Spec:</h4> 
             <p>The Project Explorer is the central location for working with projects in the IDE. Source files and objects are directly available in the Project Explorer and all configuration and management action for the project are available through contextual menus in the Project Explorer. The Project Explorer contains all open projects and project groups and is made up of two tabs, Logical View and Files View. Modules may add additional tabs if they need to break their projects into more views.</p> 
             <p>The Logical View provides a project specific logical view of project contents. The Files View shows all files and folders present in the project regardless of what kind of project it is. The view is very similar to the 3.x filesystems view in that every source root is a node under the project node. The contents of the Files Views are: </p> 
             <pre>
-My_Project
 |	  
 - c:\My_Project	        &lt;- project root = implicit source root
 | |
 | + My_Project.project  &lt;- project file and any other files and directories
 |                          contained in the project root (project file location).
 + Additional_Source_Root_1
 |
 + Additional_Source_Root_2
 |
 + Additional_Source_Root_n

 </pre> 
             <p>For every source root there is one child node of the project node. The project root is the implicit source root and is the first node underneath the project node. All the additional source roots are defined in the Sources &amp; Files page of Project Customizer.</p> 
             <p>Actions between the two views should be consistent. Whatever action is available on an object in one view should also be available on the corresponding object in the other view. Exceptions would be objects in the logical view that are aggregates of more than one physical thing -the action may not make the same sense for the individual pieces as it does for the aggregate.</p>

|\ Logical View /\ Files View /                |
+----------------------------------------------+		
		</pre> 
             <p>Components of the dialog:</p> 
             <ol> 
              <li>Logical View tab. Shows the logical view of the project. The structure of the logical view is entirely provided by the module(s) that provide that project.</li> 
              <li>Files View tab. Shows the project contents as files and folders. Projects are listed in the same order as they appear in the Logical View. Children of the Project node in the Files View are all source root.</li> 
             </ol> 
             <p> In addition to displaying sources and files in the project the Project Explorer indicates which project is active. One project is always Active -if there is only one project open then it is automatically Active, when there are multiple projects open one is at all times Active.</p> 
             <p>The active project is indicated with a bold project node title. A context menu item on non-Active projects lets the user set those projects to active.</p> 
             <h4>Java UI Spec:</h4> 
             <p>The Logical View in the Project Explorer provides a Java specific view of the project contents. All source roots that contain java roots contribute to a merged view in the Logical view so that all like <a href="http://projects.netbeans.org/terms/ProjectsConcepts.html#2.2">package fragments</a> form one node under the Project node. </p> 
             <p>A top-level package node is created from all Package Fragments that contain only Java source or are empty. If a package fragment <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">org.netbeans.modules.java</font> contained <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">foo.java</font>, it would be a top-level node in the Packages node. If bar.java was in the package <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">org.netbeans.modules</font> then the top-level node would be <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">org.netbeans.modules</font> and it would contain the Java source <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">bar.java</font> and the sub-package <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">java</font>. </p> 
             <p>Two or more java roots may contain Java sources that are in conflict -meaning that two java roots provide the same package fragments and source files of the same name. When this happens the order of the java root determines which source is used for build (the first in the Project Customizer, Sources and Files list gets preference). Both files are shown and the remaining files in conflict are badged so the user can resolve the conflict (or not) as necessary. </p> 
             <p>The conflict badging also depends on how the Compiled Classes Build Target is setup; conflicting classes in the Packages node will be badged with more information based on where they are used. If there is only one Compiled Classed node the file that is not used is marked [unused]. When there are more than on Compiled Classes Build Target and each has a slightly different order of Java Roots the classes in conflict can each be annotated with the name of the Build Target that uses them - [default Build Target], [test Build Target], [deployment Build Target]. This clarifies where each file is used.</p>

             <p>Special nodes can be added dynamically to a project as the user may create or add content that is provided for with specific categorization, e.g. JUnit functionality might break tests out as a separate node 'JUnit Tests'. </p> 
             <p><strong>Open Questions: </strong>Should the 'Packages' node reappear when additional logical groupings are added to the view or should it be visible all the time regardless if it is the only gouping? Should the likely additional groupings (i.e. unit tests) be included automatically if a module that provides support is installed?</p>

             <p>Bugs: <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33603">33603</a></p> 
             <p>Priority: P1</p> 
             <p>Repeatedly, participants in the Usability Study looked for one central place to set project options. To address this issue it is recommended that:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>All customizers be centralized into the Project Customizer (Infrastructure/Java Project):</strong> The centralization will help users not yet familiar or comfortable with the highly context sensitive nature of NetBeans and it will make using Configurations (or the love child of Profiles and Configurations) easier as there will be one place to manage settings (and choose which configuration to use). The context sensitive entry points will open the Project Customizer to the relevant location. </li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>This recommendation will also resolve issues of the same customizer being shown in different ways -with all customizers a part of the larger Projects Customizer the presentation will be consistent.</p> 
             <p>The model for the Projects Customizer is the same as the <a href="../../docs/hi/options/index.html">Options redesign</a> work. </p> 
             <p>Another point to consider is looking at a subset of project options that make sense to display as properties and not as members of a customizer. </p> 
             <h4>Infrastructure UI Spec:</h4> 
             <p>A single Project Customizer will contain all customizers that are relevant for the project. The basic customizer contains General project settings, Source directory settings, Resource settings, Build Step settings, Running Profiles and provides space for additional projects-specific settings. All customize actions in the project explorer will open the main Project Customizer to the correct panel -thus context sensitive entry points are preserved while providing a single location to manage project settings. Build Configuration management is also combined into the Project Customizer allowing the user to create new Build Configurations, choose which Build Configuration to use and provide better management of Build Configuration settings.</p> 
             <p>The project customizer is a modal dialog. The dialog consists of a list of categories along the left side of the panel and a corresponding panel of options on the right. The list consists of all context sensitive entry points in the project explorer along with a functional grouping of project specific settings. Along the bottom of the dialog are Ok and Cancel buttons.</p> 
             <p>The Build Configurations category is a special customizer category. It allows the user to create, delete and make a specific configuration active. The list of configurations is then used in other configuration dependent customizer categories, e.g. a specific build step. The combobox listing all the build configurations is shown above the configuration dependent customizer to let the user know that all the changes made in the customizer panel are stored only into this configuration.</p> 
             <p>Modules or project natures can add categories and sub-categories to the left hand list. Where necessary they may also replace or hide certain categories (i.e. Resources may be replaced with a category that makes more sense for the project nature). The recommended approach is to use tabbed options panes in the right when there are more sub-categories; however, when the number of tabs to the right exceeds what can reasonably be displayed in one row it is recommended to create sub-categories in the left hand list and move some of the tabs into the newly created sub-categories. A categories which contain build configurations dependent setting have to be shown bellow the Build Configuration category. </p>

              <li>Build steps list. Space for rent by modules to list what build steps are present in the project. Modules may complete replace this panel with their own UI -what is here comes from free from the infrastructure. The default build step is bold with the (Default) word appended.</li> 
              <li>Add... button. Adds a new build step by bringing up the New... wizard. After closing the wizard the new build step in the category list gets selected. The button is always enabled.</li> 
              <!--<li>Edit... button. Brings up the build step editor. Only enabled
      if a build step is selected.</li>--> 
              <li>Remove button. Removes the selected build step. Only enabled if a build step is selected. The user is also asked if they want to remove the associated build step directories.</li> 
              <li> Set Default button. Makes the selected build step default. Disabled if the selected build step is the default.</li> 
             </ol> 
             <p>When adding or editing a Build Step to the project the wizard or customizer that facilitates the action needs to include as a step or part of the customizer the following UI to specify the output directory. This UI is necessary only for build steps that produce some kind of output.</p>

             <ol> 
              <li>Output Directory text field. Provides a directory under which built output can be collected. By default, this text field is populated with "&lt;project-home&gt;/output". Each build step stores its built output under a subdirectory that bears the build step's name. In other words, a single build step stores its output under "&lt;output-directory&gt;/&lt;build-step-name&gt;/". Note that the use of this umbrella output directory for any one build step is optional. The build step may let the user choose a completely different directory for the built files, or it may use none at all.</li> 
              <li>Browse... button. Opens a jfilechooser for selecting the output directory.</li> 
              <li>Append a sub folder checkbox. If checked, then a set of subdirectories is created under the umbrella step. Each subdirectory bears the name of one of the current settings configurations. If an individual build step is using these default output directories, then its own folder is moved to be underneath this configuration sub folder. Thus, a single build step stores its output under "&lt;output-directory&gt;/&lt;settings-configuration-name&gt;/&lt;build-step-name&gt;/". This box is checked by default.</li> 
              <li>Preview of out directory. A read only textfield with the output directory. The content changes based on the state of the check box. When the string is too long to be completely visible in the text field it should be possitioned so that the end (right most) of the string is visible.</li> 
             </ol> 
             <p>The customizer of a specific Build Step instance contains the Build Configuration selector.</p>

If selected directory is underneath an existing source root then it is added as its child. The user can then define the role (Package Root) of this directory. If a completely new source location is selected a status dialog opens and a heuristic check determines if the source root or its children can be used as java roots:</p>

              <li>If a source root is a java root it is added to the tree-table and the Package Root role is selected by default. A java root is considered the directory containing sources (i.e. in /src/org/netbeans/modules, src is the java root).</li> 
              <li>If a source root contains java roots some number of directories below the source root is added to the tree-table and each java root is added as a child of the source root in the tree-table. The children nodes are listed as the full path relative to the source root that contains them. The parent source root does not have selected role but each of the found java root does.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>The dialog below contains two source roots. The first is the project root that contains two java roots: c:\myProjects\funny\src and c:\myProjects\funny\lib, the second is a simple java root located at c:\mySources\stuff\src.</p>

              <li>Sources and Files list: Tree-table displaying source roots on the left and how they are used on the right. Java roots and source roots that contain no java roots are single row nodes in the tree-table. Source roots that contain java roots show the java roots as children of the source roots.</li> 
              <li>Role column. Displays and allows the user to specify the role of directory in the project. The values for regular source items are "Package Root" and "Plain Source Root".</li> 
              <li>Add... button. Opens a filechooser. The user selects the location to add. After clicking Ok in the filechooser a heuristic search checks if the source root added contains java source. A progress dialog may be shown during the search.</li> 
              <li>Remove button. This button is only enabled if something is selected in the source contents list. Removing source roots follows these rules: 
               <ul> 
                <li>Removing a row that does not have children removes the row.</li> 
                <li>Removing a row that does have children removes both the row and all of its children</li> 
               </ul> Remove button is disable if the project directory is selected. </li> 
             </ol> 
             <p>The Resources contains tabs for each of the different types of project wide resources. A single resource can be added to more than one tab though generally, the tabs are used for resources that are separate. The resources edited in this category are applied project wide. Order and use are used as default values for Build Steps and Running Profiles but both may change the order and or usage or project wide resources. See below for more details.</p>

            <h3><a name="roots"></a>Java Root/Source Root interaction</h3> 
            <blockquote> 
             <p>Bugs: <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33597">33597</a>, <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33599">33599</a></p> 
             <p>Priority: P1</p> 
             <p>The Java root/Source root distinction confused most of the participants as well and from further review really seems to be an implementation detail and not a user level concept (or at least not a very clear user level concept). The problem that this is solving is two fold: 1. a requirement at the time was that it was unacceptable to mix java and non-java source nodes under one container (the Source node); 2. the Packages node communicates what has been effectively added as sources to the classpath of the project.</p> 
             <p>These two problems can still be solved but with Source and Java root removed from the user experience. The main idea is to remove the user concept of Java and Source roots from the UI and let the containers and logical structure of the project define those differences without special terminology. To do so some basic interaction needs to be changed:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Adding Sources from the wizard (Java Project):</strong> User adds only source files. After doing so the IDE works out if the new source root is a java root or contains a java root. If it is a java root it will be selected for the classpath by default; if it contains one or more java roots they will be shown as children of the source root and also added to the project classpath by default. See the Sources and Files customizer in the Project Customizer section.</li> 
              <li><strong>Split Logical and Physical views in the Explorer:</strong> By splitting the views the idea that the Packages node is a sub-set of project contents is clearer. See the Explorer section for more details.</li> 
             </ul>

            <h3><a name="profiles"></a>Profiles</h3> 
            <blockquote> 
             <p>Bugs: <a href="http://ui.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=33606">33606</a></p> 
             <p>Priority: P2</p> 
             <p>Profiles were confusing to all participants. They only added complexity to what should have been a very task -running the project or a class therein. Running a project and running a class should be very straight forward; one set of recommendations is to:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Remove the Profile setup as a necessary step (Infrastructure):</strong> When a project is run with no main class set a dialog opens that lets the user select from the runnable classes in the project. Finding runnable classes may take some time so the search mechanism shows status and can be canceled. Selecting this class creates a profile with the same name but does not actually open the profile dialog.</li> 
              <li><strong>Automatically create and set a profile active (Infrastructure/Java Project):</strong> When a new runnable class is created a profile for it is automatically created (the profile should have the same name as the class) and the wizard contains an option to use that class when running the project.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>The same rules should be applicable to debugging.</p> 
             <p>Another complexity is the typing of profiles -the difference between running and debugging adds a layer to the interaction that may not need to be there. The recommendation is to:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li><strong>Remove Profile types -run/debug (Infrastructure):</strong> Have only one type of profile for running or debugging. This profile is active or not and applies to both project wide run and debug actions. If the active profile cannot be used for one of the actions (run or debug) a dialog warns the user with the option to change the active profile or not.</li> 
             </ul> 
             <h4>Infrastructure UI Spec:</h4> 
             <p> Profiles still maintain the same functionality but the project specific handling of how to automatically create and manage projects to streamline running a project is more clearly specified in the Java UI Spec.</p> 
             <p>The only change necessary in the Infrastructure UI Spec is the removal of typing between run and debug profiles.</p> 
             <h4>Java UI Spec:</h4> 
             <p>Profiles manage how the project is run and are necessary for a project to be run or debugged. The user manages profiles through the Project Customizer. The user gets to the Profiles section by either opening the Project customize from the Project node or through the Run | Edit Profiles menu item in the main menu. The main menu item opens the Project Customizer for the selected project or the active project if no project is currently selected. The profile editor panel dialog lets the user create new and edit existing profiles. </p> 
             <p>When there are multiple profiles one must be set as active so the project can be run or debugged. The active profile is normally used for both running and debugging; however, if the profile uses something that cannot be used for one or the other of these actions a dialog will warn the user and let them select a different profile to complete the action.</p> 
             <p>Profiles for runnable objects can be created:</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li>as part of the new wizard when a runnable object is being created</li> 
              <li>as a search for runnable objects if no profile has been set up</li> 
              <li>as the result of a manual add through the profile editor dialog</li> 
             </ul> 
             <p>Automatically created profiles are named after the package and classes they use (e.g. org.netbeans.modules.Main). </p> 
             <p>Profiles are deleted when the class they use is deleted, removed or edited so that it is no longer runnable. When a class that a profile depends on is moved (cut/paste) the profile stays in synch with the class move -the user should not have to change anything provided the class is moved to a location still within the classpath of the project.</p> 
             <h5>New Profile from New Class Wizard:</h5> 
             <p>When creating a new runnable class the final step allows the user to specify whether to create a profile or not. The default is to create a profile for a runnable class with default execution for the type of class being created (class execution, applet execution, etc) The final panel looks like this:</p>

             <p>Main menu structure contributed to a confusion of participants. The goal of recommendations is to fix the ordering and structure of main menu items and incorporate changes that reflect other usability recommendations. </p> 
             <p> <b>Expose "Customize Project" menu item in the Project menu</b>. Customization of project is centralized in one place, containing all the project pieces. The menu item allowing access to the project customizer should be put at more visible place in the main menu. </p> 
             <p> <b>Remove items for creating a new resource and output from main menu</b>. Items for creating a new resource and new output are removed from the main menu as a result of moving Resources and Output management into project customizer.</p> 
             <p><b>Expose build steps in the main menu</b>. Build Steps (former Output Nodes) are removed from the explorer. Therefor it is needed to allow the user easy access to building a project using also other than the default build step.</p> 
             <p><b>Merge run/build profiles menus</b>. It should works the same way as selecting the active configurations. Or if it works as now, then we should change the name and position of actions, e.g. "Run Active Project With &gt;", "Run Active Project in Debugger With &gt;". </p>

As defined in the spec the active project serves purpose of fixed entry point for starting execution an debugging.

The set of templates the user can choose from would be determined from the open projects. All the templates would be listed in the wizard, but only those templates which are accepted by the open projects are enabled inside the template selector. The target selection in the next wizard step should allow the user to select any project which accepts selected template in the previous step. Of course, the current project is target project by default. Allowing the user to select a different than the current project in the second step of the wizard should help solving a situation when user realizes in the second step that incorrect project is the current project. So instead of closing the wizard she would just select select a different project. <br>&lt;/Not yet agreed on&gt; </p>

             <h2>1 New Project Wizard</h2> 
             <p> Going through the new project wizard results in a new project. By default, the project is populated with enough skeleton code to be a) immediately buildable/runnable, and b) useful for starting to build whatever it is that the user wants to build. (Exactly what this skeleton code consists of is left to the individual modules.)</p> 
             <h3>1.1 Page 1: Select Project Type</h3> 
             <p> The first page of the New wizard shows all current project types, arranged by category. The page will be largely similar to the current page, but the structure of the templates will be: </p>

             <h4>Java UI Spec:</h4> 
             <h2>1 New Java Project Wizard</h2> 
             <p>This section is the specification of the New Java Project Wizard.</p> 
             <h2>2 Use Cases</h2> 
             <h3>2.1 Create a java project from existing sources</h3> 
             <p> The goal of creating a java project from existing sources is to create and set up a project, so that it can be build/run without any extra effort. One of the project creation steps is to specify where are the existing project directories located. It includes existing packages, libraries, output directories and other project files/directories. Possible layout of existing source directories:</p> 
             <ol> 
              <li> Simple project with one src directory, one directory containing libraries and one output directory. <pre> 
    ../project/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>out</b>/..
    ../project/<b>lib</b>/..
    ../project/<b>manifest.mf</b>
    ../project/<b>build.xml</b></pre> </li> 
              <li> Simple project with one src directory, a directory containing testing sources, one lib directory and one out directory. <pre> 
    ../project/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>testsrc</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>out</b>/..
    ../project/<b>lib</b>/..
    ../project/<b>manifest.mf</b>
    ../project/<b>build.xml</b>
</pre> </li> 
              <li> Project with two source directories and central dir for unit tests. Central build script creates jar files for both source directories. The project has one lib directory, two output directories, one doc directory and a few "non-java" source directories, e.g. db - contains db scripts, model - contains project specification documents, config - contains project configuration files (manifest.mf, ...). <pre> 
    ../project/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>libsrc</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/test/unit/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>out</b>/..
    ../project/<b>out_distrib</b>/..
    ../project/<b>doc</b>/..
    ../project/<b>lib</b>/..
    ../project/<b>db</b>/..
    ../project/<b>model</b>/..
    ../project/<b>config</b>/..
    ../project/<b>build.xml</b>
</pre> </li> 
              <li> Project with two subprojects, each containing more source directories. Unit test directory is centralized. Central build script creates jar files also for subprojects. Each subproject contains build scripts for building a subproject. <pre> 
    ../project/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>libsrc</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/<b>out</b>/..
    ../project/<b>lib</b>/..
    ../project/subproject1/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>libsrc</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>out</b>/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>lib</b>/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>manifest.mf</b>
    ../project/subproject1/<b>build.xml</b>
    ../project/subproject1/<b>libsrc</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/subproject2/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>out</b>/...
    ../project/subproject1/<b>lib</b>/...
    ../project/subproject2/<b>manifest.mf</b>
    ../project/subproject2/<b>build.xml</b>
    ../project/test/unit/<b>src</b>/org/netbeans/...
    ../project/test/unit/<b>build.xml</b>
    ../project/<b>manifest.mf</b>
    ../project/<b>build.xml</b>
</pre> </li> 
             </ol> 
             <h3>2.2 Create a java project from scratch</h3> 
             <p> Creating a new java project from scratch requires specifying at least one java package root directory. All of the other files and directories are created during project development. So, the project starts as something very simple and becomes complicated (in directory structure) during project development. </p> 
             <h3>2.3 Create a new java project from predefined directory structure</h3> 
             <p> Sometimes, development teams use the same standardized directory structure for all projects. In such case they might create directory structure for a new project outside of the IDE. </p> 
             <h2>3 New Java Project Wizard Specification</h2> 
             <p> Only one template for creating a java project is provided. This template should be used for all identified ways of creating a java project (see above). One template makes template selection straightforward, minimizing possibility of mistake in the first step of the wizard. </p> 
             <h3>3.1 Page 1: Select Project Type</h3> 
             <p> The first step of the new project wizard is defined in the infrastructure UI spec. The next pages of the new java wizard are shown if the user selects "Java Project" template in the first page. </p> 
             <h3>3.2 Page 2: Project Name and Location</h3> 
             <p> The panel shown in the second step is taken from the infrastructure spec. </p>

</pre> 
             <p> The panel components are specified in the project customizer section. The default values of the Sources and Files table depends on project file directory.</p> 
             <ul> 
              <li> If the project file directory is empty or doesn't yet exist, a new java package root directory named "src" is created underneath the project file directory. Both directories, the project file directory and new java package root are shown in the table. "src" dir is shown as the project root. <pre>
    /home/dr/Projects/myJavaProject
      + src                                 [Package Root] 
    </pre> This should satisfy creating a java project from scratch as defined in 2.3. If the user is creating a new project from scratch or new project from existing source, but doesn't want to have the project file at the same location as project content, then she should remove offered values from the table manually and specify a new location with Add button. </li> 
              <li> If the project file directory is not empty, but doesn't contain any directories which has been identified as package roots, then the wizard suggests to use "src" folder underneath the project file directory. If the "src" directory doesn't exists then it is created. So it works the same way as in the previous bullet point. This matches the 2.2 use case. </li> 
              <li> If the project file directory contains subdirectories which are a valid java roots then these are listed in the table. Project file directory is listed too as the source root. <p> The default values for the 2.1.1 directory structure are: </p><pre> 
    /space/project
      + src                                 [Package Root]

             <h3>3.5 Page 5: Project Default Output</h3> 
             <p> Fifth step of the wizard is used for setting up the output directory of default build target. This is the only step which is completely different from the project customizer panels. It is because the build steps concept would be too difficult for the first time users. So, the wizard asks only a simple question for setting up the default build target correctly. </p>

             <h2>1 New File/Folder Wizard</h2> 
             <p> The user creates a new file/folder with the New File/Folder Wizard. The wizard pages are following.</p> 
             <h3>1.1 Page 1: Select Template</h3> 
             <p> The first step of the wizard contains categorized list of templates used for file and folder creation. This list contains all the known templates. </p> 
             <p> Some of the templates can be instantiated only in an appropriate type of projects, therefor the list is adopted depending on the open projects. All the templates are listed, but templates that can not be instantiated in any of the open project are disabled (icon and title are shaded out). Selecting a disabled template doesn't enable the Next button.</p> 
             <p> Disabling an items in the template list should help the user to avoid mistakes of selecting a template that can not be instantiated. The alternative way how to do that is to hide templates that can not be instantiated in any of the project (or show only templates that can be instantiated only in the current project). Both alternatives introduce the problem of floating set of choices. </p> 
             <p> To improve the user performance, a template category that would more likely be used with the current project is preselected and expanded by default. Next time a recently used template in the current project context is selected. </p>

             <p> The second step of the wizard asks the user for the name and location of the new file/folder. The location specification depends on the template type. It means the template determines how the target panel looks like. E.g. for a java class it will contain a packages field; for a text file it will display a folder field. </p> 
             <p> All the target location fields should be filled according to a current context by default. It means the project, source folder, package, etc is filled into appropriate fields. If the template can not be instantiated in the current project then the first project which accepts the template, according to the order of projects in the explorer, is used. </p>
