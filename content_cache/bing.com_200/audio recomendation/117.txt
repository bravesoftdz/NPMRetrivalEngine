  <h2>JLayer MP3 Library</h2> 
  <p><br> <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html">JLayer 1.0</a> is a popular open source MP3 player for Java. Is has all kinds of features. You can download it directly from <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/sources.html">javazoom.net</a>. This includes all of the <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/docs/docs1.0/index.html">documentation</a> and the jar file <a href="jl1.0.jar">jl1.0.jar</a>. </p>

  <h2>How to Play an MP3 File</h2> 
  <p><br> The file <a href="MP3.java.html">MP3.java</a> is a bare bones Java program that uses JLayer to play the MP3 file specified on the command line. It plays the MP3 file in a separate thread, so you are free to perform other computation while the song plays. In order to compile and execute it, you need to put the file <a href="jl1.0.jar">jl1.0.jar</a> in your current working directory (or classpath). Instructions for compiling and executing (depending on your operating system) are included in the .java file. </p>
