       <p>If you created a pretty Excel table and now want to publish it online as a web page, the simplest way is to export it to an old good html file. In this article, we are going to explore several ways of converting Excel data to HTML, determine pros and cons of each, and walk you through the conversion process step-by-step.</p> 
       <ul class="nav"> 
        <li><a href="#save-as-webpage">Convert Excel table to HTML by saving as web page</a></li> 
        <li><a href="#excel-2html-converters">Excel to HTML converters</a></li> 
        <li><a href="#excel-web-viewers">Excel web viewers</a></li> 
       </ul> 
       <h2><a name="save-as-webpage"></a>Convert Excel tables to HTML using "Save as Web Page" option</h2> 
       <p>Using this method you can save an entire workbook or any portion of it, such as a selected range of cells or chart, to a static web page (.htm or .html) so that anyone can view your Excel data on the web.</p> 
       <p>For example, you have created a feature-rich report in Excel and now want to export all the figures along with a pivot table and chart to your company's web-site, so that your workmates can view it online in their web-browsers without opening Excel.</p> 
       <p><img class="imgl2" title="The original Excel table to be converted to an HTML file" alt="The original Excel table to be converted to an HTML file" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/excel-table-convert-html.png"></p> 
       <p>To convert your Excel data to HTML, perform the following steps. These instructions apply to all "ribboned" versions of Excel 2016, 2013, 2010 and 2007:</p> 
       <ol> 
        <li>On the workbook, go to the <i>File</i> tab and click <b>Save As</b>. <p>If you want to export some portion of data only, e.g. a range of cells, pivot table or graph, select it first.</p></li> 
        <li>In the <b>Save As</b> dialog, choose one of the following: 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>Web Page</b> (.htm; .html). This will save your workbook or the selection to a web page and create a supporting folder that will store all of the page's supporting files such as images, bullets and background textures.</li> 
          <li><b>Single File Web Page</b> (.mht; .mhl). This will save your workbook or the selection to a single file with supporting files embedded into the web page.</li> 
         </ul> <p><img class="imgl2" title="Saving an Excel worksheet as a webpage" alt="Saving an Excel worksheet as a webpage" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/save-as-webpage.png"></p></li> 
        <li>If you selected a range of cells, a table or a chart before clicking <i>Save as</i>, then select the <b>Selection</b> radio button, click <b>Save</b> and you are close to finished.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="Saving the selected part of an Excel workbook as web page" alt="Saving the selected part of an Excel workbook as web page" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/save-selection.png"><p></p> <p>If you have not selected anything yet, continue with the following steps.</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>To save the entire workbook</b>, including all the worksheets, graphics and tabs for navigating between sheets, select <b>Entire Workbook</b>.</li> 
          <li><b>To save the current worksheet</b>, choose <b>Selection: Sheet</b>. In the next step you will be given a choice whether to publish the whole worksheet or some of the items.</li> 
         </ul> <p><img class="imgl2" title="Save the entire workbook or the selection." alt="Save the entire workbook or the selection." src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/save-entire-workboook.png"></p> <p>You can also set a title for your web-page now by clicking the <b>Change Title...</b> button in the right-hand part of the dialog window. You will also be able to set or change it later, as described in step 6 below.</p></li> 
        <li>Click the <b>Publish</b> button and this will open the<b> Publish as Web Page </b>dialog window. Let's briefly go through each of the available options, from top to bottom.</li> 
        <li><b>Items to publish</b>. Here you choose what portion(s) of your Excel workbook you want to export to a web-page. <p>In the drop-down list next to <i>Choose</i>, you have the following choices:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>Entire workbook</b>. The whole workbook will be published, including all of the worksheets and tabs to navigate between sheets.</li> 
          <li><b>Entire worksheet or certain items</b> on a worksheet, such as <i>pivot tables</i>, <i>charts,</i> <i>filtered ranges and External data ranges</i>. You select "<i>Items on SheetName</i>", and then choose either "<i>All contents</i>" or particular items.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="Choose whether to publish the entire worksheet or certain items." alt="Choose whether to publish the entire worksheet or certain items." src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/save-sheet-items.png"></li> 
          <li><b>Ranges of cells. </b>Select <i>Range of cells</i> in the drop-down list and then click the <em>Collapse Dialog</em> icon to select the cells you want to publish.</li> 
          <li><b>Previously published items</b>. Select this option if you want to republish a worksheet or items you have already published. If you'd rather not republish a certain item, select the item in the list and click the <i>Remove</i> button.</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
        <li><b>Title of the web-page. </b>To add a title that will be displayed in the title bar of the browser, click the <b>Change</b> button next to <i>Title:</i> and type in the title you want.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="Adding a web-page's title" alt="Adding a web-page's title" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/add-title.png"></li> 
        <li>Click the <b>Browse</b> button next to <i>File name</i> and choose the hard drive, folder, web folder, web server, HTTP site, or FTP location where you want to save your web page. 
         <div class="sm-tip"> 
          <p><b>Tips:</b> If you are converting an Excel workbook to an HML file for the first time, it makes sense to save the web page onto your local hard drive first so that you can make the needed corrections before publishing the page on the web or your local network.</p> 
          <p>You can also choose to export your Excel file to an <b>existing web page</b> provided that you have permissions to modify it. In this case, upon clicking the <i>Publish</i> button, you will see a message prompting you to choose whether you want to overwrite the content of the existing web-page or append your data to the end of the web page. If the former, click <i>Replace;</i> if the latter, click <i>Add to file</i>.</p>
         </div> </li> 
        <li>Select "<b>AutoRepublish every time this workbook is saved" </b>if you want to have the workbook or selected items automatically republished after each saving of the workbook. I'll explain the <a href="#autorepublishing">AutoRepublish feature in more detail</a> further on in the article.</li> 
        <li>Select the "<b>Open published Web page in browser</b>" check box in case you want to view the web page right after saving.</li> 
        <li>Click the <b>Publish</b> button and you are done! <p>As you can see in the screenshot below, our Excel table looks fairly nice online, though the design of the original Excel file is a bit distorted.</p> <p><img class="imgl2" title="An Excel table published as a web page" alt="An Excel table published as a web page" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/excel-table-online.png"></p> 
         <div class="sm-note">
          <b>Note:</b> The HTML code created by Excel is not very clean and if you are converting a large spreadsheet with a sophisticated design, it may be a good idea to use some HTML editor to clean up the code before publishing so that it will load more quickly onto your web site.
         </div> </li> 
       </ol> 
       <h3>5 things you should be aware of when converting an Excel file to HTML</h3> 
       <p>When you use Excel's <i>Save as Web Page</i> function, it is important that you understand how its main features work in order to avoid most typical mistakes and prevent common error messages. This section provides a quick overview of the options you should pay special attention to when exporting your Excel spreadsheet to HTML.</p> 
       <ol> 
        <a name="links"></a>
        <p></p> 
        <li><b>Supporting files and hyperlinks</b> <p>As you know, web pages often contain images and other supporting files as well as hyperlinks to other web-sites. When you convert an Excel file to a web page, Excel automatically manages the related files and hyperlinks for you and saves them to the supporting files folder, named <i>WorkbookName_files</i>.</p> <p>When you save the supporting files such as bullets, graphics and background textures to the same web server, Excel maintains all the links as <b>relative links</b>. A relative link (URL) points to a file within the same web site; it specifies the file name or a root folder only rather than the full website address (e.g. href="/images/001.png"). When you delete any item saved as a relative link, Microsoft Excel automatically removes the corresponding file from the supporting folder.</p> <p>So, the main rule is to <b>always keep the web page and supporting files in the same location</b>, otherwise your web page may no longer display properly. If you move or copy your web page to another location, be sure to move the supporting folder to the same location to maintain the links. If you re-save the web page to another location, Microsoft Excel will copy the supporting folder for you automatically.</p> <p>When you save your web pages to different locations or if your Excel files contain hyperlinks to external web sites, <b>absolute links</b> are created. An absolute link specifies the full path to a file or a web-page that can be accessed from anywhere, e.g. www.your-domain/products/product1.htm.</p></li> 
        <li><b>Making changes and re-saving a Web page</b> <p>In theory, you can save your Excel workbook as a Web page, then open the resulting web page in Excel, make edits and re-save the file. However, in this case some Excel features will no longer be working. For example, any charts contained in your workbook will become separate images and you won't be able to modify them in Excel as usual.</p> <p>So, the best practice is to maintain your original Excel workbook up to date, make changes in the workbook, always save it as a workbook (.xlsx) first and then save as a Web page file (.htm or .html).</p></li> 
        <li><a name="autorepublishing"></a> <b>AutoRepublishing a Web page</b> <p>If you selected the <b>AutoRepublish</b> checkbox in the <i>Publish As Web Page </i>dialog discussed in step 8 above, then your web page will get updated automatically every time you save your Excel workbook. This is a really helpful option that lets you always maintain an up-to-date online copy of your Excel table.</p> <p>If you have turned on the AutoRepublish feature, a message will appear each time you save the workbook asking you to confirm whether you want to enable or disable AutoRepublish. If you want to have your Excel spreadsheet republished automatically, then naturally select <b>Enable...</b> and click <i>OK</i>.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="Enabling the AutoRepublish feature" alt="Enabling the AutoRepublish feature" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/autorepublish.png"></p> <p>However, there are some circumstances when you may not want to republish your spreadsheet or selected items automatically, e.g. if your Excel file contains confidential info or has been edited by someone who is not a trusted source. In this case, you can make AutoRepublish temporarily or permanently unavailable.</p> <p>To <b>temporarily disable </b>AutoRepublish, select the first option "<i>Disable </i><i>the AutoRepublish feature while this workbook is open</i>" in the above-mentioned message. This will turn off auto-republishing for the current session, but it will be enabled again the next time you open the workbook.</p> <p>To <b>permanently disable </b>AutoRepublish for all or selected items, open your Excel workbook, choose to save it as Web page and then click the <i>Publish </i>button. In the <i>Choose</i> list, under "<i>Items to publish</i>", select the item you do not want to republish and click the <b>Remove</b> button.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="Permanently disabling the AutoRepublish feature" alt="Permanently disabling the AutoRepublish feature" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/disable-autorepublish.png"></p></li> 
        <li><b>Excel features not supported in web pages</b> <p>Regrettably, a couple of very useful and popular Excel features are not supported when you convert your Excel worksheets to HTML:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>Conditional formatting</b> is not supported when saving an Excel spreadsheet as a <em>Single File Web Page</em> (.mht, .mhtml), so make sure you save it in the <em>Web Page</em> (.htm, .html) format instead. Data bars, color scales, and icon sets are not supported in either web page format.</li> 
          <li><strong>Rotated or vertical text</strong> in not supported either when you export Excel data online as a Web page. Any rotated or vertical text in your workbook will be converted to horizontal text.</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
        <li><b>Most common issues when converting Excel files to HTML</b> <p>When converting your Excel workbook to a web page, you may run into the following known issues:</p> 
         <ul> 
          <li><b>Cell's content (text) is truncated</b> or not completely displayed. To prevent text from being cut off, you can either turn off the wrapped text option, or shorten the text, or widen the column width, also make sure the text is aligned to the left.</li> 
          <li>The items you save to an existing Web page always <b>appear at the bottom of the page</b> while you want them at the top or in the middle of the page. This is a normal behavior when you choose to save your Excel file as an existing web page. To move your Excel data to another position, either edit the resulting web-page in some HTML editor or rearrange the items in your Excel workbook and save it as a web page anew.</li> 
          <li><b>Links on the web page are broken. </b>The most obvious reason is that you have moved either the web page or the supporting folder to another location. See <a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/03/21/convert-excel-html/#links">supporting files and hyperlinks</a> for more details.<b></b></li> 
          <li><b>A red cross (X) is displayed on the Web page</b>. A red X indicates a missing image or other graphic. It may get broken for the same reason as hyperlinks. Just make sure you always keep the web-page and supporting folder in the same location.</li> 
         </ul> </li> 
       </ol> 
       <h2><a name="excel-2html-converters"></a>Excel to HTML converters</h2> 
       <p>If you often need to export your Excel tables to HTML, the standard Excel means we have just covered may seem a bit too long way. A faster method is to use an Excel to HTML converter, either online or desktop. There are a handful of online converters on the Internet both free and paid and we are going to try a few right now.</p> 
       <h3>TABLEIZER - free and simple Excel to HTML online converter</h3> 
       <p>This one-click online converter handles simple Excel tables with ease. All you need to do is to paste the contents of your Excel table to the window and click the <b>Tableize It!</b> button. Some basic formatting options such as font size, font type, header color, and even CSS styles are available.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="TABLEIZER - free and simple Excel to HTML online converter" alt="TABLEIZER - free and simple Excel to HTML online converter" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/tableizer-converter.png"></p> 
       <p>After that you just copy the HTML code generated by the Tableizer converter and paste it to your webpage. The best thing when using this tool (apart from speed, simplicity and no cost : ) is the preview window that shows how your Excel table is going to look like online.</p> 
       <p>However, the formatting of your original Excel table will not be automatically converted to HTML as you see in the screenshot below, which is a very significant drawback in my judgment.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="An Excel table converted with Tableizer" alt="An Excel table converted with Tableizer" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/tableizer-data-converted.png"></p> 
       <p>If you are interested to try this online converter, you can find it here: <a href="http://tableizer.journalistopia.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tableizer.journalistopia.com/</a></p> 
       <p>Another free Excel to HTML converter is available at <a href="http://pressbin.com/tools/excel_to_html_table/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pressbin.com</a>, though it yields to Tableizer in many respects - no format options, no CSS and even no preview.</p> 
       <h3>Advanced Excel to HTML converter (paid)</h3> 
       <p>Unlike the two previous tools, the <b>SpreadsheetConverter</b> works as an Excel add-in and requires installation. I've downloaded a trial version (as you understand from the heading, this is commercial software) to see if it is in any respect better than either free online converter we've just experimented with.</p> 
       <p>I must say I was impressed! The conversion process is as easy as clicking the <i>Convert</i> button on the Excel ribbon.<br> <img class="imgl2" title="The SpreadsheetConverter button on the Excel ribbon" alt="The SpreadsheetConverter button on the Excel ribbon" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/spreadsheet-converter-button.png"></p> 
       <p>And here is the result - as you can see, the Excel table exported to a web-page looks very close to the source data:<br> <img class="imgl2" title="An Excel table exported to a web-page with Spreadsheet Converter" alt="An Excel table exported to a web-page with Spreadsheet Converter" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-html/spreadsheet-converter-result.png"></p> 
       <p>For the sake of experiment, I've also tried to convert a more complex workbook containing several sheets, a pivot table and a chart (the one we <a href="#save-as-webpage">saved as web page in Excel</a> in the first part of the article) but to my disappointment the result was much inferior to what Microsoft Excel produced. Maybe this is just because of the trial version's limitations.</p> 
       <p>Anyway, if you are willing to explore all the capabilities of this Excel to HTML converter, you can download an evaluation version of the SpreadsheetConverter add-in <a href="http://www.spreadsheetconverter.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p> 
       <h2><a name="excel-web-viewers"></a>Excel web viewers</h2> 
       <p>If you are not happy with the performance of Excel to HTML converters and are looking for alternatives, some web viewer may work a treat. Below you will find a quick overview of several Excel Web Viewers so that you can get a feel of what they are capable of.</p> 
       <p><a href="https://sheet.zoho.com/excelviewer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zoho Sheet online viewer</a> allows viewing Excel spreadsheets online by either uploading a file or entering the URL. It also provide an option to create and manage Excel spreadsheets online.</p> 
       <p>This is probably one of the most powerful free online Excel viewers. It supports some basic formulas, formats and conditional formatting, allows you to sort and filter the data and convert it to a number of popular formats such as .xlsx, .xls, .ods, .csv, .pdf, .html and others, as you see in the screenshot below.</p> 
       <p><img class="imgl2" title="An Excel table in the Zoho Sheet online viewer" alt="An Excel table in the Zoho Sheet online viewer" src="https://cdn.ablebits.com/_img-blog/excel-online/zoho-sheet-features.png"></p> 
       <p>Its main weakness is that it does not keep the format of the original Excel file. I also have to admit that Zoho Sheet web viewer was not able to cope with a sophisticated spreadsheet containing a custom table style, complex formulas and a pivot table.</p> 
       <p>You can also check out a couple of other Excel web viewers, e.g. <a href="http://xmlgrid.net/excelViewer.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">XML Grid.net</a> and <a href="http://www.editgrid.com/viewer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EditGrid</a>, but these are much inferior in terms of features and supported formats.</p> 
       <p>Well, we have explored a few options to convert Excel spreadsheets to HTML. Hopefully, this will help you choose the technique in accordance with your priorities - speed, cost or quality? The choice is always yours : )</p> 
       <p>In the next article we are going to continue this topic and investigate how you can move your Excel data online using <a href="https://www.ablebits.com/office-addins-blog/2014/03/28/excel-online-create-web-based-spreadsheets/">Excel Web App and Excel Online</a>.</p>

           <p>Hi Svetlana</p> 
           <p>This is a great little tutorial, unfortunately I cannot get any charts to publish - I just get the red x.<br> There are no supporting files, so there are no missing graphics.<br> But before I even get that far I don't get the option to pick a chart when I select Items on Sheet - it just says "Sheet All contents of Sheet" but is grayed out.</p> 
           <p>Any clues?</p>

             <p>Hi Chris,</p> 
             <p>It's very hard to pin down the cause of the problem without seeing your workbook. This might happen if the workbook is read-only and no edits including export are allowed. If this is not the case, then please specify what Excel version you use. Also, do you want to publish the entire content or charts only? </p> 
             <p>If you could send us a screenshot with the grayed out options or even better your sample workbook to <a href="mailto:support@ablebits.com">support@ablebits.com</a>, then we will definitely be able to to figure this out.</p>

           <p>Hello and thank you for this very in-depth page! I'm having an issue that I don't think is addressed - I'm trying to create an HTML file from an XLS doc with drop downs. After conversion, the drop downs are not active. They're integral to the spreadsheet because choosing an item in the list dictates the specific data that populates on the page. Does that make sense? </p> 
           <p>Is there a way to create an html doc that will allow these drop downs to stay active?</p>

             <p>In case of frequent updates, a more efficient way is publishing your workbook online and linking it to your website.

           <p>I am trying to get a small excel file to save as an 'interactive' webpage. The process seems to be missing from excel 2010.

             <p>Hello, Dorn, </p> 
             <p>Unfortunately, the option to publish interactive web pages was removed after Excel 2007.<br> You can try the following steps:<br> Upload the Excel file to your OneDrive, right-click the uploaded file, select "Embed &gt; Generate" to create the html code you need.</p>

           <p>Hi,<br> I am trying to save my excel table to html format with a few columns hidden. When I try to link it to a sharepoint at as a page viewer, I tested the link and it was still ok before I press apply. However, when I press apply, the whole table gets shown and my hidden columns were exposed in the web part. Can anyone advice on how to hide these columns when you do publishing online? Thanks!</p>

           <p>Hi Svetlana,<br> Could you please tell me about how can we import data in excel from website. If am having 5 to 6 websites date want to download at a time, how much duration (time) it will take. If there any option or code to decrease the download time. This is my 1st issue.</p> 
           <p>And 2nd issue is difference between dates calculation. If A2 cell having 02/03/2016 and A3 cell 02/04/2016, when I used datedif(A2,A3,d) it is calculated between days is 0(only). But there is difference between two date is 1 day. And how can I subtract number of days like 2 or 3 or 5 days in a month days (days 2 (minus) February 29 days) answer is obviously 27. But I want to get through formula</p>

           <p>Hi,</p> 
           <p>Is there either a free, or relatively inexpensive option to convert my Excel 2007 sheets, that contain simple formulas and drop down lists to HTML? Simplified, an example of my excel sheet is:</p> 
           <p>Cell.(Assume column "A" states descriptions for column B)</p> 
           <p>B1: Blank number input<br> B2: =SUM(A1*4)<br> B3: Drop down with "Yes" &amp; "No" choice<br> B4: =IF(B3="Yes",B2*0.0085/12,IF(B3="No","B2*0.0085/4"))</p> 
           <p>My excel sheet has 3 columns and 25 rows, but nothing that is anymore complicated that what I stated above.</p> 
           <p>I found a spreadsheet convertor that does EXACTLY what I want, plus MANY things I do not need for nearly $300USD. Is anyone aware of an alternative?</p>

           <p>I'm wanting to regularly re-publish what is currently a small worksheet as a html page with a javascript plugin or my own javascript to make a filter and search feature. So need either the plain html table without junk, i.e. html tags only, or output as xml so I can make the required xslt. Seems like need to create some silly xml mapping for excel to spit out xml. The whole process will have to become semi-automated, so I'm wary of online copy-paste operations that are more suitable for one of things. Excel plugins are out of the question.<br> I need to make the process simple and tech dummy proof as well.</p>

           <p>I use the "save as" webpage option to post to my company's intranet. But lately when we are on the step of saving as a webpage after saving the excel file we are getting the message as the .htm is in use. The person who it claims is using it we have had log off their computer because they don't have the file open. But still no one can save as a webpage. No problem updating the file as the excel spreadsheet and resaving but just not able to save as a .htm file.</p>
