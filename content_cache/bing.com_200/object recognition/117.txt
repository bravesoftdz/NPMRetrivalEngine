<a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:bold" href="http://golem5.org/embedcv/">EmbedCV</a><br>
A robot needs a computer vision system that can run on a single board computer. Many image processing and
computer vision libraries make design tradeoffs favoring broad algorithm coverage, accuracy and
extensibility rather than performance on a small platform. While this is good for applications
with workstation class computers, it is bad for small robots and other deeply embedded systems.
<p>
EmbedCV does not try to do everything. It is only focused on embedded computer vision practical
for low-end computing platforms (e.g. a 200 MHz ARM or Pentium single board computer). So EmbedCV
trades accuracy for speed and has a very limited selection of algorithms. It is not a general
purpose image processing library.

        <p> The RoboRealm application was created back in 2006 to take advantage of (1) lower cost generic computing (i.e. PCs), (2) a widening range of lower cost imaging devices, (3) an increasing need and usage of vision as primary sensor device and (4) the desire to quickly research custom solutions using an interactive user interface with minimal programming. </p>

									RoboRealm's technical vision is to create technology to completely understand the content of an
									image. It is very clear that the human visual system (HVS) is years ahead of what is currently possible in
									an automated fashion. RoboRealm seeks to close that gap by constantly introducing new modules that create
									new possibilities for our customers. We prioritize directly from customer feedback to understand which new
									modules would be best received by our customer base. As we provide free updates for a year after
									purchase, this is a very active channel of communication.
