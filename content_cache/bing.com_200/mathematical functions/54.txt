  <p> This demonstrates one program from the package, "graphing", of Java classes I am developing to use for graphing mathematical functions in educational demonstrations.</p>
  <p> The applet on this page illustrates how you construct the integral of a function as the sum of the areas of larger and larger numbers of strips. You can draw the graph of a function and then move the slider bar to show the strips that make up the left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums. You can also display the areas of the sums of the strips at any stage. </p>

   <dt>
     Adding Functions 
   </dt>
   <dd>
     Press "Add Function" button and type in a formula to be graphed in standard mathematical notation (eg "
    <tt>e^(-x/10)sin(x)</tt>"). The only variable the formula can use is 
    <tt>x</tt>. You can add as many functions as you like, and "Delete Function" deletes the last one you entered. 
   </dd>
   <dt>
     Rescaling 
   </dt>
   <dd>
     This brings up a panel which you can use to edit the scale of the graph. The 
    <tt>x</tt> variable runs between 
    <tt>xMin</tt> and 
    <tt>xMax</tt>, and the 
    <tt>y</tt> values run between 
    <tt>yMin</tt> and 
    <tt>yMax</tt>. Use 
    <tt>xScale</tt> and 
    <tt>yScale</tt> to set the spacing of tick marks on the axes. If 
    <tt>xScale</tt> or 
    <tt>yScale</tt> is zero, the graph will have no tickmarks on that axis. 
   </dd>
   <dt>
     Riemann Sums 
   </dt>
   <dd>
     Move the slider bar to vary the number of strips in the Riemann sums. The control buttons set whether or not to show the value of the Riemann sum in the screen, and whether to use left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums. 
   </dd>
