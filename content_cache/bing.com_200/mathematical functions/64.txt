  <p>I have written a Java class package for completing a variety of useful mathematical tasks. This package currently consists of the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>MathTools: A generic collection of small static methods that accomplish a range of things including determining if a number is even or odd, calculating the cube root of a number, the base 10 or base 2 logarithm of a number, round a number to a specified decimal place, the greatest common divisor between two numbers, the fractional part of a number, hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic tangent and their inverses, natural log of the gamma function, and methods for converting between binary and decimal representations of numbers. And much, much more.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>Fraction: A class for representing a fraction in rational form. A rational fraction is one that is represented as a ratio of whole numbers numerator/denominator. It can also be represented as a whole number plus a fractional part which is a numerator over a denominator. This class provides methods for doing some simple arithmetic with rational fractions and an elegant method for converting an arbitrary floating point number to a rational fraction to a specified tolerance. For example, it will convert the decimal fraction 0.3333333333 to the rational fraction 1/3.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>Polynomial: A class that represents an arbitrary polynomial equation of any degree. The coefficients of the polynomial may be either real or complex. Includes a general zero or root finder, using the method of Jenkins and Traub, that returns all the real and complex zeros of the polynomial. Makes use of and depends on the Complex class found on the <b><a href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib Repository</a></b>. The Complex class from Netlib is included in this download for convenience.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>Roots and Evaluatable1D: A pair of classes used to find a root to a specified and arbitrary 1D or ND equation. Two methods for finding 1D roots are provided. The method that is chosen depends on whether or not your function returns a derivative (slope) value or not. If it does not, then the Van Wijngaarden-Dekker-Brent method (or Brent's method) is used. if it does return a derivative value, then a generally faster converging Newton-Raphson technique is used. In both cases, care is taken to avoid pathologies by using root bracketing and simple bisection if convergence problems are encountered. For n-dimensional functions, a globally convergent Newton's method with either a Jacobian supplied by the user or one computed by differencing.<br> <br> </li>
   <li>Minimization: Provides methods that isolate the minimum/optimum to a 1D or nD function. Brent's method (with or without derivatives) is used for 1D function minimization. nD functions are minimized using Powell's method if no derivatives are supplied or Polak-Reibiere's method if they are.<br> <br> </li>
   <li>Quadrature: Provides a collection of methods for numerically integrating equations. Includes Simpson's Rule, Gauss-Legendre, and adaptive Gauss-Lobatto methods.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>TaylorSeries: A class that represents a Taylor series expansion of an arbitrary function f(x) centered at x0. Includes a means of generating a Taylor series for the trigonometric functions sine and cosine and the exponential function e^x.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>Statistics: A collection of useful utility methods for calculating statistical properties of sets of data. Includes min, max, range, sum, mean, percentile, median, 1st and 3rd quartile, root mean square, variance, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis.<br> <br> </li> 
   <li>LinAlg: A collection of useful utility methods for doing linear algebra (matrix math). These are Java implementations of a few of the famous Fortran BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra System) and LINPACK (Linear Algebra Package) routines. I have been porting the BLAS/LINPACK algorithms from Fortran as I've needed them for my own projects. To date, the following routines have been ported: geco, gefa, gesl, axpy, dot, scal, iamax, asum, mxpy, and the LINPACK benchmark. In most cases, both single and double precision versions are available.<br clear="all"> <br> </li> 
   <li>Digital Filters: &nbsp;A set of classes that implement various digital filter algorithms as used in control system modeling. &nbsp;Currently available are an integrator, first-order lag, and a washout high pass filter.<br clear="all"> <br> </li> 
   <li>ModelData: &nbsp;A class used to create curve fits to measured data. &nbsp;Can fit any functional relationship as long as a basis function is provided. &nbsp;Currently there is only a polynomial curve fit basis function included.<br clear="all"> <br> </li> 
   <li>Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Integrators: &nbsp;A fix step size 4th Order Runge-Kutta integrator and a variable step size 4th-5th Order Runge-Kutta integrator are provided.<br> </li> 
  </ul>
