Since 2008, DSC has been providing <b>Care Services</b> that individuals can subscribe using our online registration process. Once enrolled, these individuals can receive their daily calls. DSC also provides an <b>eCARE Community Service</b> that allows law enforcement and community groups to enroll individuals within their community and receive CARE calls. </p>

This online service is a calling program that contacts individuals at home to ensure they are OK. This service is ideally suited for small to medium communities where there are a limited number of seniors enrolled. </p><p> <a href="http://www.callingcare.com/care-organizations.htm"><b><u>Police and Sheriff's organizations</u></b></a> as well as other senior communities can benefit from this service. Instead of managing computer systems, modems and telephone lines, administrators can focus on the enrollment and management of seniors within the community. Administration can be performed on any device that has internet access from virtually any location. </p><p> Senior citizens can enroll in this program through local community organizations such as their police or county sheriff's office. Enrollment is easy, yet it provides the senior with flexible calling schedules and multiple contacts in the event of an emergency. </p><p> Rather than using a dedicated phone line attached to your computer, eCARE calls are made from a bank of phone lines maintained at our call center. Considering the cost of today's phone lines, several seniors could be called with just that savings alone. </p>
           <ul>
            <i><b> <li><font color="maroon" size="3">No phone line(s)</font> or monthly phone bills.<br> </li><li><font color="maroon" size="3">No software</font> licensing or maintenance.<br> </li></b></i>

           </ul> <p> eCARE is a service that uses our computer phone systems and software to place calls to seniors living at home alone. The senior is instructed to acknowledge the call using the "Press 1" option on the phone keypad. If the call is not answered or the senior does not acknowledge the call, an alert sequence is initiated that calls or emails family or friends of the senior. If the senior has no one to check in on them, the calls and alerts can be sent to the eCARE management center which is typically the local police or sheriff's office. An alert is also posted online informing the center that the senior did not respond. </p>
