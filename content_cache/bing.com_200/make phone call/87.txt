              <ul class="noHide"> 
               <li>Make and receive calls using a traditional corded or cordless phone connected to your home phone jack. </li> 
               <li>Manage your calls easily through an online account manager that allows you to enable advanced call forwarding and blocking features, to retrieve your voice mail through a compatible computer, and lots more.</li>

            <li class="firstQ"><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="Javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleQuestionarie(this)">How does Fios Digital Voice Work?</a> 
             <ul>

               <ul class="noHide"> 
                <li>In the case of an electrical outage, your Fios Digital Voice service will continue to operate on battery power if your FioS equipment has a power backup option installed with active batteries (Please refer to the backup power option screen for details on power backup options available from Verizon) . It will not be possible to make or receive calls, including emergency calls to 911, without charged batteries or other backup power source until commercial power is restored. </li> 
                <li>Home security systems using an in-house jack can be used for Fios Digital Voice without impacting security services. In the event of a power outage, the same power backup limitations apply to your alarm system.</li>

              <li> <p align="justify">A: You are responsible for providing the electrical power necessary for the Service to function. The Service (including 911 dialing) will not function during a power outage without a back-up power source. A battery back-up feature is available for your Verizon equipment. Depending on your equipment type, you may choose to use this battery back-up feature by maintaining a (i) 12 Volt battery in the built-in battery backup-unit or (ii) D Cell batteries in the optional Power Reserve that plugs into your equipment. You may determine your battery backup equipment type at Verizon.com/myverizon.</p> <p align="justify">With a fully-charged battery (or batteries), the battery back-up feature will power the basic calling functions of your Service for up to eight (8) hours in the event of a power outage. Power Reserves that use 12 D Cell batteries may be purchased through Verizon. 12 Volt batteries may be purchased through Verizon or a third party. The battery back-up feature will not power Fios Internet or Fios TV service. A power failure or service disruption may require you to reset or reconfigure equipment prior to using the Service. </p> </li>
