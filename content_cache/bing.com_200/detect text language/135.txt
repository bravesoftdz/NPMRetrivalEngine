  <p> You may want to print these instructions before proceeding. You should read each step completely before performing the action it describes. Because these products may change slightly each semester, I would appreciate it if you would let me know if you find any discrepancies between these instructions and what actually happens when you try to follow them. </p>
  <p> <b>IMPORTANT: Install Java first, BEFORE you install Eclipse.</b> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr align="left" width="100%"> 
  <h2>Java</h2> 
  <p> The following instructions were composed for installing Sun Java 1.5.0_08 (aka JDK 5.0 update 8). This may not be the latest version, but it is the one that we are using this semester. Note: Java is already installed as part of Mac OS X, so no further installation is necessary for these machines. Ensure, though, that you have the right version by typing <b>java -version</b> to the unix command prompt; the response should be something like <b>java version "1.5.0_08"</b> </p>
  <p> A typical Java installation takes about 400 megabytes of disk space. The installation process reports the exact size. </p>

  <h3>Downloading</h3> 
  <ol> 
   <p> </p>
   <li>Click <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" target="_blank"> Java SE Downloads</a><br> A page, with this label in orange, will be displayed in your browser. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Find the section labeled <b>JDK 5.0 Update 8</b> and click its <b>Download</b> button (the fourth one from the top). Click <b>Yes</b> to the <b>Security Window</b> pop-up, if it appears. A page, with the label <b>Download</b> in orange, will be displayed in your browser. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Accept</b> button, which appears under <b>Required</b> in red (it is in a small font: look for it carefully).<br> Again, click <b>Yes</b> to the <b>Security Window</b> pop-up, if it appears. This page will re-display itself, with this information absent. <p> </p><p> </p></li>
   <li>Find the black bar labeled <b>Windows Platform - J2SE(TM) Development Kit 5.0 Update 8</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the link labeled <b>Windows Online Installation (typical download size is ~33.7MB), Multi-language</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Save the file it is about to download somewhere on your disk drive. The file will be named <b>jdk-1_5_0_08-windows-i586-p-iftw.exe</b>. The exact form of this interaction will depend on the version of your operating system (on mine clicked <b>Save</b> to the <b>File Download - Security Warning</b> pop-up; then I specified the location for the file; and then I clicked <b>Close</b> to the <b>Download complete</b> pop-up). Store this <b>exe</b> file somewhere permanent on your disk drive, so that you can reexecute it (reinstall Java) later, if necessary. This file is only about 250KB (1/4 MB). <p> </p></li>
   <li>Terminate (<b>X</b>) any windows remaining from this process (e.g., the <b>Download</b> window). </li>
  </ol> 
  <hr align="left" width="33%"> 
  <h3>Installing</h3> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Double-click the file that you just downloaded, to run it.<br> Click <b>Run</b> to the <b>Open File - Security Warning</b> pop-up. You will see a <b>Windows Installer</b> window temporarily then a <b>Preparing to Install</b> window temporarily. You will then see a <b>License Agreement</b> window. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>"I accept the terms..."</b> button. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button.<br> You will see a <b>Custom Setup</b> window, for <b>J2SE Development Kit 5.0 Update 8</b>. The default is to get a full installation (~264Mb), which is what you want. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button.<br> <p> </p></li>
   <li>You will see an <b>Installing</b> window (for <b>J2SE Development Kit 5.0 Update 8</b>), whose progress is shown by progress bars (on various panes). Be patient: many megabytes of information is being downloaded and then used to perform the actual installation; sometimes the progress bars lool like they are making no progress. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Eventually, you will see another <b>Custom Setup</b> window, for <b>J2SE Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 8</b>. The default is to get a full installation (~131Mb), which is what you want. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button.<br> <p> </p></li>
   <li>You will see a <b>Browser Registration</b> window. Select whatever browsers you want to register for, <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Next&gt;</b> button.<br> <p> </p></li>
   <li>You will see another <b>Installing</b> window (for <b>J2SE Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 8</b>), whose progress is shown by progress bars (on various panes). This installation will take less time than one for the Development Kit. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Finish</b> button on the <b>Installation Completed</b> pop-up window. </li>
  </ol> 
  <p> </p>
  <hr align="left" width="100%"> 
  <h2>Eclipse</h2> 
  <p> The following instructions were composed for installing Eclipse 3.2 on Windows. The process for Mac/Linux should be similar. If later versions of Eclipse come out before I update these instructions, you might have to go through a slightly different process (please contact me if you do). </p>
  <p> A typical installation takes about 134 Mb of disk space (plus the 120 Mb download, which you should keep on your machine, in case you need to reinstall it). </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>Downloading</h3> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Click <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_blank"> Eclipse 3.2</a><br> A page, with the label <b>eclipse downloads</b>, will be displayed in your browser. <p> </p></li>
   <li>In the first section, find the text <b>Download Now: Eclipse SDK 3.2, Windows (120 MB)</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the icon to the left of this text, or the part of the text labeled <b>Eclipse SDK 3.2</b><br> If you are using a Mac, it should sense it and display <b>Mac</b> instead of <b>Windows</b>. If you are not using the operating system it recognizes, click the link labeled <b>Other downloads for 3.2</b> instead. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the icon to the left of the text <b>Download from:</b> for using the default mirror site (or click a site from the list displayed in the box). <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Save</b> button to download, somewhere on your disk, the file named <b>eclipse-SDK-3.2-win32.zip</b> (for PCs). The exact form of this interaction will depend on the version of your operating system. Store this <b>zip</b> file somewhere permanent on your disk drive, so that you can unzip it (recreate Eclipse) later, if necessary <p> </p></li>
   <li>Terminate (<b>X</b>) any windows remaining from this process. </li>
  </ol> 
  <hr align="left" width="33%"> 
  <h3>Installing</h3> 
  <ol> 
   <li>Unzip this file that you just downloaded.<br> On most Windows machines, you can 
    <ul> 
     <li>Right-click the file. </li>
     <li>Move to the <b>WinZip</b> command. </li>
     <li>Click <b>Extract to here</b> </li>
    </ul> It creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b>. You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your disk drive. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file.<br> On most Windows machines, you can 
    <ul> 
     <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b> </li>
     <li>Drag it to the desktop. </li>
     <li>Release the right button. </li>
     <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b> </li>
    </ul> Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created. In the <b>Workspace Launcher</b> window, in the box following <b>Workspace:</b>, should appear something like <b>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>username</i>\workspace</b> (where <i>username</i> is your login on the machine). If you want, you can type in (or browse) another location for the workspace file to be created, but I advise accepting the default. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Check the box labeled <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b>.<br> Aside: you will be using one workspace during the semester, checking projects in and out of this workspace. If you ever want to re-enable the display of this window, once Eclipse starts, you can 
    <ul> 
     <li>Select <b>Window | Preferences</b>. </li>
     <li>Click the <b>+</b> in front of <b>General</b> or double-click <b>General</b> (after the +) </li>
     <li>Click <b>Startup and Shutdown</b> </li>
     <li>Check the box labeled <b>Prompt for workspace on startup</b>. </li>
    </ul> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click <b>OK</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>If you want easy access to the workspace, create a shortcut to it (see the instructions above), putting the shortcut on your desktop. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Download (right-click and <b>Save As</b>) <a href="../classes/cs15-1xx.library.jar"> Course Library Jar</a> into the same folder that you are using as your workspace (or move this file in the workspace fodler after downloading it elsewhere). <p> </p></li>
   <li>In Eclipse, select <b>Windows | Preferences</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>+</b> in front of <b>Java</b> or double-click <b>Java</b> (after the +) <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click <b>Installed JREs</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Under the <b>Name</b> column, double-click <b>jre1.5.0_08</b>. <p> </p></li>
   <li>Click the <b>Add External Jars...</b> button. <p> </p></li>
   <li>In the <b>Jar Selection</b> window, navigate to your workspace folder, and double-click the file <b>cs15-1xx.library</b>. <p> </p></li>
   <li>In the <b>Edit JRE</b> window, click <b>OK</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>In the <b>Installed JREs</b> window, click <b>OK</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Terminate (<b>X</b>) the <b>Welcome</b> window<br> You can always get it back by selecting <b>Help | Welcome</b> <p> </p></li>
   <li>Terminate (<b>X</b>) the Eclipse window. </li>
