For example, the test can be used to compare the distribution of diseases in a certain locality with an expected distribution on the basis of national or international experiences using an ICD classification. In a two-category array the multinomial test provides a two-sided solution for the Binomial test. For example, Multinomial {10 20 0.20 0.80} gives the two-sided probability (0.105) for the single sided Binomial {0.20 10 30} probability (0.061). The multinomial allows you to work with empty '0' observation cells although you must have an expectation about a cell.

       <li> Hypergeometric -- calculates the hypergeometric probability distribution to evaluate hypothesis in relation to sampling without replacing in small populations </li> 
       <li> Binomial -- calculates probabilities for sampling with replacing in small populations or without replacing in very large populations. Can be used to approximate the hypergeometric distribution. The binomial is probably the best known discrete distribution. </li> 
       <li> Poisson -- calculates probabilities for samples which are very large in an even larger population. Is used to approximate the binomial distribution, try to compare it with the binomial! The distribution is more often used in a completely different way, for the analysis of how rare events, such as accidents, cumulate for a single individual. For example, you can use it to estimate your chances of getting one, two, three or more accidents in any one year considering that on average people get 'U' accidents per year. </li> 
       <li> Negative binomial -- Also used to study accidents, is a more general case than the Poison, it considers that the probability of getting accidents if accidents clusters differently in subgroups of the population. However, the theoretical properties of this distribution and the possible relationship to real events are not well known. </li> 
       <li> Negative binomial -- Another version of the negative binomial, this one is used to do the marginal distribution of binomials (try it!). Often used to predict the termination of real time events. An example is the probability of terminating listening to a non-answering phone after n-rings. </li> 
       <li> Multinomial -- Same as the multinomial above, this one for DOS computers. </li> 
       <li> Fisher -- Is used to calculate the exact p-value in 2*2 tables. It is o.k. for one sided testing but not so exact for two sided testing, where there are different theories about how to do it. The sum of small p-values is the most used method, but there does not seem to be a good rationale for that. Use the fisher exact instead of the Chi-square when you have a small value in one cell or a very uneven marginal distribution. </li> 
       <li> SPRT -- This method of analysis is not often used, which is a pity because it is actually quite good. It is based on the case of phenomena being observed, tested, or data collected, sequentially in time. The testing or data collection is stopped as soon as some upper or lower limit is crossed of the proportion positive or negative events or outcomes relative to the total number observed. Was originally developed to keep the costs of 'destructive' testing low. Is sometimes used in medical trials to monitor the amount of negative side effects and to decide if the trial should be stopped because the number of side effect is considered unacceptably high. </li> 
       <li> Chi-square -- Calculates the Chi-square and some other measures for two dimensional tables </li> 
       <li> CASRO -- Calculates response rates according to different procedures. The CASRO (Council of American Survey Research Organizations) procedure is the 'accepted' procedure for surveys. </li>
