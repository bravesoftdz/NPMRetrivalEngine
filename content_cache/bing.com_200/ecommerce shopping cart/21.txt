Features such as coupons, live shipping rates, promotions, and many more are not included in the FREE version.

         <dd> 
          <p>The FREE plugin is the full WordPress ecommerce shopping cart software version; however, the PRO and administrative software that is downloaded from our website is licensed software. The PRO software will add all core features and the Premium version will allow access to our administrative software, apps, and extensions. You may continue to run the FREE WordPress plugin, but must purchase a license to use our PRO or administrative software.<br> Each license is good for one website URL or WordPress installation. You may transfer a license from a development environment to a production environment at any time; it is your license once you purchase one.<br> Licensing gives you features such as coupons, promotions, live shipping rate calculators and more. Plus you will receive support from our staff individually rather than through our community open support systems. For more information on licensing, you can view our website.</p>

            <p>I love the new admin design and all the features the Easycart platform offers. It is easily worth it to try the free version and the professional at only 99 bucks. So cheap for what you get!</p> 
            <p>I had great support with any questions I asked. Very timely response. They also have great online support center with nice helpful videos.</p> 
            <p>The software itself has so many features I cant even start to list, but the new interface backend is so well designed and easy to maneuver through. Feels very nice, and highly recommend. I will be using on my next sites for sure!</p>

            <p>I am very pleased to say that since our company went live with the EasyCart shopping cart, we have been very happy with the results. EasyCart has some great features out of the box and we were able to implement some creative workarounds for some of our tricky areas. The EasyCart developers also made some helpful additions to the cart that further sealed the deal. Although it took us a while to get it set up like we wanted, we feel it has been worth the effort. </p> 
            <p>Our company is no stranger to ecommerce and have had an online shopping cart since the 1990’s. We have used and tested many carts over the years (both hosted and self hosted solutions) and feel that EasyCart brought us full circle to a great flexible product with high value.</p> 
            <p>We are able to handle a wide variety of complex products with options that have equally complex shipping requirements. We also appreciate how easy it is to change the look and feel of the cart to match the design of our WordPress template. EasyCart does some amazing things for the store owner.</p> 
            <p>Quickbooks : One of the most important requirements we needed was to integrate our ecommerce system with Quickbooks. We were originally attracted to EasyCart because of it’s Quickbooks plugin however we found that it did not work as desired and soon thereafter, EC decided to stop development on it. At first we thought that may be a deal killer but again, with some help from the awesome EasyCart developers, we were able to use a really great third party solution, TransactionPro Import Wizard (by Bay State Consulting, a Quickbooks Gold Developer). </p> 
            <p>To save you hours of time, I will be happy to send you a few files that are necessary to set it up with EasyCart if you purchase TransactionPro through us. It’s the same price no matter where you get it but if you use our affiliate link, we get a little kickback and we’ll give you the files to easily connect to your EasyCart store. You can also create these on your own but these files will save you hours and you’ll be up and running in no time. You have nothing to loose. It’s a win-win for all. Buy <a href="https://stompin-ground.com/transactionpro-import-wizard/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TransactionPro</a> now or <a href="https://stompin-ground.com/information/contact/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contact Us</a> for more information.</p> 
            <p>In conclusion, we really appreciate EasyCart and we’re so glad we found it. The EasyCart developers are helpful and forward thinking. When we look at the big picture, it’s simply the best shopping cart system for our demanding needs. </p> 
            <p>This is a solid ecommerce system…<br> <strong>WordPress </strong>– Powerful websites for the people<br> <strong>EasyCart </strong>– An amazing shopping cart<br> <strong>Quickbooks </strong>– The best accounting software for business<br> <strong>TransactionPro </strong>– Perfect Quickbooks data management</p> 
            <p>Thank you EasyCart! We’re very pleased!</p>

            <p>I have been dealing with EasyCart for about a year and I had never used the system prior. So, there was a bit of a learning curve. BUT, BUT, BUT, they are truly superior when it came to the support I needed and with every single question I had. They totally nailed it! They went way above and beyond the call of duty. It was a great alternative to WOO. The back end is filled with everything, even videos! </p> 
            <p>We are a HTML based developer and so the whole WP thing was a mess for us, so we really appreciated all the extra hand holding. Now, we are going to use it again for another site now that we are more familiar. Great work guys!</p>

            <p>Yea, go ahead and use this and migrating your site will be a PAIN. It took longer to migrate the store than it did to migrate wordpress. You have to specifically download a .sql file just for this store? Then you have to re-install the plugin (which will require changing your maximum upload size because they didn’t do a good job compressing it). I’m not going to go through the whole procedure, but it’s a pain. And could have been avoided if they developed this plugin in an orthodox manner.</p>
