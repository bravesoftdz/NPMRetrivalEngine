   &lt;body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000"&gt; &lt;H1&gt;Encrypt HTML source, protect web site. Javascript and ASP code encryption! Protection of images, links. Encryption of e-mail in HTML format! &lt;/H1&gt; &lt;p&gt;HTML Guardian is the most advanced tool to &lt;b&gt;encrypt html&lt;/b&gt; source and &lt;b&gt;password protect web site&lt;/b&gt; content entirely - including Javascript source code, VBscript and ASP files, cascading style sheets (.css), images in many formats and many other components of your site. It can also secure HTML formatted email. &lt;b&gt;Encryption&lt;/b&gt; will protect your images, links, applets and flash animations from stealing and leeching, it will make absolutely impossible linking your content from other web sites. Protection is done by converting files into encrypted javascript code. The original look of your web pages will not be affected in any way - they will look exactly the same as before in any browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visit our partner site, &lt;a href="http://www.encrypt-html.com"&gt;Encrypt HTML leader Code Protection Technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="encrypt_html.gif" alt="Encrypt HTML source" border="0"&gt; &lt;a href="encrypt_html.htm"&gt;Encrypt HTML code&lt;/a&gt; and make impossible stealing it! Protected code can't be reused or edited in any HTML and/or text editor. Changing even a single character in it will make the file non-working. No portion of the &lt;b&gt;encrypted html&lt;/b&gt; can be just copied and pasted in some other file. &lt;br&gt; Lots of other great features further enhance your intelectual property protection. You can disable right mouse button click, printing of the pages (actually this feature will cause only blank pages to be printed) , text selection and copying and offline usage of encrypted files(they will work if requested from a web server, but will not if the user tries to open them from a local hard drive), set expiration date etc. You can also &lt;b&gt;html password protect web page&lt;/b&gt; files and add referrer check security to them (this means to limit which web sites can link your pages and for which this is prohibited - a very useful feature to prevent opening of your website in frames). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Visit our Yahoo.com group or MSN.com group to discuss web intellectual property security related issues.&lt;a href="http://www.protware.com/faq1.htm"&gt;Read our FAQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="encrypt.html"&gt;Compare HTML Guardian&lt;/a&gt; with the other tools that protect web pages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="encrypt_javascript.gif" alt="Encrypt Javascript code"&gt;&lt;a href="encrypt_javascript.htm"&gt;Encrypt Javascript&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone can get the unencrypted source of your &lt;a href="scripts.htm"&gt;javascript&lt;/a&gt;, modify it a little bit and then reuse it according to his/her needs. Developing of complicated scripts and dhtml effects and their debugging and optimization could be a very time consuming process, but to modify a ready script to fit your needs is very easy and can be done even from people with a very basic knowledge. If you scramble it this will be completely impossible. Changing even one character will make the script totally nonworking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="protect_images.gif" alt="Protect any images - jpg, gif, bmp"&gt;&lt;a href="protect_images.htm"&gt;Protect images - gif, jpg, bmp, png !&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; The new Image Guardian add-on provides enhanced &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="image_protection.htm"&gt;image protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for each picture in *.gif, *.jpg , *.png and *.bmp format. Theft of website images is a major concern for all webmasters who have a high quality pictures - Image Guardian will secure all your images ! and will make impossible they to be copied, linked directly from another website or retrived from the browser cache. Note that full &lt;b&gt;web image protection&lt;/b&gt; is only available in the Enterprise edition of the program - in the Personal and Professional editions this feature limited, but enough for testing purposes. A complete and detailed comparison between the Personal , Professional and Enterprise editions you can read in our FAQ, and also in the program's Help file. Currently no other product offers such a feature - this is one of the many reasons for all the experts to say HTMLGuardian is the best product of its kind available today. Actually most of them consider it the only solution to provide real security for your intellectual property - either posted online or distributed offline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="ASP_protect.gif" alt="Protect ASP code"&gt;&lt;a href="encrypt_asp.htm"&gt;Encrypt ASP source code&lt;/a&gt; You know how much time it takes to develop ASP solutions. Encrypted ASP source code is protected against theft or unauthorised reuse. This is a very useful feature for asp developers who provide their code to third parties - after you develop some solution and give it to other people, thay may then reuse it in their own asp projects and apps, or even sell it. There are also a lot of known bugs in Microsoft's asp server that make possible the original asp source to be retrived by a knowledgable person in case the server is not well configured - in such case asp encryption can be useful too. This is another unique feature of HTMLGuardian, not available in any other program / security tool at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="html_password.gif" alt="strong password protection" width="32" height="32"&gt; &lt;a href="html_password_protect.htm"&gt;Password protect HTML files&lt;/a&gt; in an extremely secure way. Versions 6.4 and later include the new Ultra - Strong password protection utility. It can &lt;b&gt;password protect html&lt;/b&gt; files with up to 384 bit keys. Just for a comparison, for online credit card payments and other transfers of sensitive information only a 128 bit encryption is used by today's browsers. &lt;br&gt; Currently there too many products available all over the place which, according to their authors, offer the same or at least comparable level of security. Actually HTMLGuardian is the only program from all that are known to us to offer such unbreakable and uncrackable , extremely secure protection. Our cryptography experts were able to crack files &amp;quot;secured&amp;quot; by all other utilities. In fact, in most cases experts were not needed at all to do that - a very basic knowledge on Javascript was enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src="html.gif" alt="Encrypt email in html format"&gt; &lt;a href="encrypt_asp.htm#p15"&gt;Encrypt email&lt;/a&gt; Email in html format can also be encrypted. If you don't want your email templates and the pictures included in them to be re - used by the people you send mail to, you can secure your e-mail. This way you will also avoid all mail censorship utilities which may otherwise block messages sent by you and make them unavailable for some of the recipients.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The program has many advanced batch processing features - you can protect not only individual web pages but also entire websites, folders or user defined file lists at once, with individual security settings specified for each page.&lt;br&gt; Although most people use the program to protect their code, images and other intellectual property, there are tons of other features - like the option to compress and optimize your source, which results in lightning fast page downloads. Read a detailed overview of all &lt;a href="features.htm"&gt;HTML Guardian features&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can &lt;a href="download.htm"&gt;download HTML Guardian here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; It's also available on almost all major shareware websites. Note however that if you download the program from some other site, it may not be the most recent version. Downloading the program from this website ensures you have the most recent, original and unmodified installer package. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; Since the Web early days, &amp;quot;borrowing&amp;quot; web content of any kind is something usual - page layouts, complicated scripts or java applets which developing and debugging can take weeks, images, style sheets, links...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; You know that creating a professional - looking web site requires a huge amount of time, effort, knowledge and experience in many different fields - from image editing to programming in several languages and marketing. But the result of all your effort can be simply taken and reused by anyone else - in today's highly competitive environment, this is something serious web designers and developers would like to avoid.&lt;br&gt; That's why more and more web designers and developers are now looking for a flexible and easy to use but powerful, reliable and secure solution to protect their web pages and &lt;b&gt;encrypt html, javascript and ASP source code&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt; As a solution for this situation, in June 1997 ProtWare released Web-Cipher !, the HTML Guardian predecessor, which quickly became extremely popular among web designers and security professionals.&lt;br&gt; Today, nearly 20 years later, HTML Guardian is de facto a world standard for protection of intellectual property on the Web. It is used by thousands of corporations and organizations worldwide, universities, schools, publishers, small businesses, non-profit organizations and individuals in more than 120 countries.&lt;br&gt; Read the glorious &lt;a href="history.htm"&gt;history of HTML Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another benefit from &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="menu.htm"&gt;encryption and source code protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is that you can avoid all web content filters ( such programs are now becoming more and more popular and widely used ) and make them useless. This can increase the number of visits to your site by several times!&lt;br&gt; Check some &lt;a href="http://www.protware.com/tech/"&gt; security, encryption and image protection related tips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To &lt;b&gt;encrypt html&lt;/b&gt; and secure our website intellectual property is of primary importance for us - &lt;br&gt; Dr. Calvin Jones, general manager for customer projects, Web-Design Studios Ltd, CA, USA &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Become an &lt;a href="aff.htm"&gt;affiliate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!--Page was last updated on : August 27, 2017 --&gt; &lt;!--revision: pw_787XUAT_217fl_AND_NS09h-105sec_L545_newhcU --&gt; &lt;!--application version:7.8.7.21 --&gt; &lt;/body&gt;
