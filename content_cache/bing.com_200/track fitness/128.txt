       <h4>General</h4> Just as Jupiter, planet of luck leaves your income sector on the 18th January, wrapping up a year that has been all about establishing the dream and the fantasy that you can hold onto, Saturn is strengthening his position in your career sector. In his final few days in your income sector Jupiter, planet of luck is abandoning all attempts to keep things real, knowing that once he leaves on the 18th January, he will never again in your lifetime, spend time in your income sector with Neptune, planet of dreams and fantasies. While Neptune will stay on until February 2012, Jupiter won’t return for another 12 years, so he’ll be long gone by then. The Sun, Mercury and Venus all move into your income sector either straight after or within weeks of Jupiter leaving and they’re the planets that will wrap up dreams and fantasies and turn them into a new sense of resolve, with Jupiter’s aim to leave you believing in what’s possible. After that Jupiter will spend the majority of the year in your communication sector, the smartest and most mentally focused part of your chart. Here Jupiter quite literally expands your mind, bringing ideas to the forefront and into reality that have probably been building for years now, but finally find their time. While Saturn will spend all but 15 weeks of the year in your career sector, giving both him and you a break between the 8th April and the 22nd July, things return with a vengeance after that, with some extreme professional opportunities from August onwards. It’s then that the income fantasies and desires planted like seeds at the start of the year are likely to bear fruit. Watch out for home, family and property opportunities mid year, especially between the 6th June and the 9th September. 
       <h4>Love</h4> You’re not going to have to wait long to find out what love has up its sleeve for you this year, with a lunar eclipse in your relationship sector on New Years Day. It’s the Full Moon in the sky on New Years Eve that within the very early hours of New Years Day will be eclipsed by the Sun and with an exceptional line up of planetary support in your sign challenging you to raise the bar. This draws your attention from the get go, to exactly where things stand and to what’s possible, knowing you have the rest of the year and a total solar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 14th July to keep things on track. As a lunar eclipse brings things to a head on the relationship front on Day 1 of the New Year, there in your sign and paying full attention is Venus, planet of love. This gives your Venus return a bit of a shake up and may cause you to rethink your expectations for the coming year. The reason why the lunar eclipse on the 1st January and the total solar eclipse on the 14th July fall in your relationship sector, is that the South Node will be positioned here for the whole of 2010, drawing a major line in the sand and making it time to move on. Once Venus leaves your sign on the 19th January things will settle down, with the first real romantic opportunities of the year arriving on the 1st April when first Venus, planet of love moves into your romantic sector, followed by the Sun and Mercury. Mercury will stay over 2 months, from the 3rd April to the 10th June, bringing an opportunity for both new romantic opportunities and for second chances. A New Moon in your romantic sector on the 14th May brings an opportunity for new beginnings. Apart from the solar eclipse in your relationship sector on the 12th July, there will be a lot of relationship focus during May, June and July, with Venus reaching your relationship sector on the 20th May, while Mercury is still in your romantic sector. With your romantic sector active from the 1st April to the 10th June and your relationship sector active from the 20th May to the 23rd July, it’s where there is cross over, from the 20th May to the 10th June, that you’ll find the best combined romantic and relationship weeks of the year. 
       <h4>Money</h4> You find yourself in an interesting situation as you move into the New Year, for there is a mix of financial urgency and patience, which if taken as a whole could cause some confusion, which is why it needs to be separated out. The patience is coming from Mars, an unlikely source as the planet of passion, drive and ambition usually causes an extreme amount of hype and urgency when he visits your financial sector, once every 2 years. However, on the 21st December 2009 Mars turned retrograde and will remain in retrograde motion until March 2011. Here until the 7th June, he has both time on his side and a preoccupation with the past. This means that as far as things on the financial front as a whole are concerned, there is no drive or push forward and instead a drive to turn back, cover ground already covered, take your time, work behind the scenes or retrace your steps. Mars, a planet that normally encourages you to act first and think second, is reconsidering his options. This means that as far as your financial situation as a whole is concerned, you're in a remedial phase, where it’s about fixing things up or seizing missed opportunities, before moving on. Over in your income sector things are very different, for here there is an extreme amount of urgency. Jupiter, planet of luck, good fortune and expansion is leaving your income sector on the 18th January, not to return for another 12 years. Added to the urgency is the fact that while Jupiter will return in 12 years time, by then Neptune, planet of dreams and fantasies will be gone and they will never meet up here again, in your lifetime. Venus will reach your income sector on the 19th January and the Sun the day after, on the 20th January, followed by Mercury on the 10th February. They’ll take care of the details and will focus on turning Jupiter and Neptune’s dreams and ideals into reality, but they need the raw materials to work with. This means that until the 18th January it’s all about having the dream and the fantasies, focusing on the ‘what’, rather than on the ‘where, when and how’. Once Jupiter leaves your income sector there’s a frantic scramble to get things on track, until things settle down by the 2nd March. Neptune will remain in your income sector until February 2012, keeping your expectations strong and continuing to attract opportunities, something important in what is destined to be a very big career year. 
       <h4>Career</h4> Even though Saturn, planet of willpower, discipline and focus, as well as your ruling planet, moved into your career sector on the 30th October 2009, he hasn’t yet fully settled in and won’t until the 22nd July. Instead he turns retrograde on the 14th January, having only barely put his head in the door and will remain in retrograde motion until he reverses all the way out, on the 8th April. He’ll be gone for exactly 15 weeks and it’s during this time you’re able to step back and digest what his first, introductory phase was all about, so that when he returns on the 22nd July you'll be lot more committed. Once Saturn returns to your career sector he’ll remain here until October 2012, so you need that break to get your bearings, for once you commit that’s it, you're committed for another 2 years. It’s while Saturn is gone from your career sector, between the 8th April and the 22nd July that your work sector will be particularly active. Your work sector will be active from when Venus arrives on the 25th April until when the Sun leaves on the 25th June, exactly 2 months later. This fits in so exactly with when Saturn will be gone from your career sector that this can’t be seen as a coincidence. This allows you to put your long term career objectives on hold, knowing you can pick them up later in July and focus exclusively on the job at hand, putting maximum effort into a work project, your current job situation or looking whether it’s time for a new job. If you are looking for a new job, then around the 12th June is a favourable time. It’s after Saturn returns to your career sector and you have things on track and you're committed to the long haul that this year’s surprise event happens, with a total lunar eclipse in your work sector on the 21st December, the first in 17 years. This is a real wildcard which is impossible to predict, other than to say that it’s likely to come from out of the blue and blindside you, but in an extremely auspicious way, so watch this space!
