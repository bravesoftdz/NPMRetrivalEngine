       <h4>General</h4> While 2010 is an extremely busy year with Jupiter, planet of luck spending the majority of the year in your work sector, along with a series of eclipses in your career sector, this is also a year that is all about you. On the 30th October 2009 Saturn returned to your sign, for the first time since he was last here, between 1980 and 1983. This brings you to the start of a brand new Saturn cycle one that will take nearly 3 decades to play out. Yet as much as this puts the focus on the future and as many opportunities as 2010 holds on the personal, financial and professional fronts, you're probably a little unsure of what you're committing to and what you really want from the future. That’s okay for that’s going to ensure that you keep your options open. Already Saturn is slowing down and on the 14th January will turn retrograde. Because he only returned to your sign at the end of October 2009 he hasn’t travelled far enough to house a Saturn retrograde period, so on the 8th April his retrograde track will take him back out of your sign. This will see him return to a behind the scenes role, where he spent from September 2007 to October 2009 preparing for your Saturn return. This is like finding yourself on life’s stage, but not sure if you're ready for the spotlight, then being given an opportunity to return to your dressing room, while you consider your options. It’s between then and when Saturn returns to your sign on the 22nd July that you’ll have an opportunity to do a lot of thinking, before finally being ready to commit to the future. Meanwhile life will go on, with 2010 holding professional opportunities and some unexpected relationship opportunities, between the 6th June and the 9th September. It’s from the 9th September all the way through to the 8th July 2011 that you'll find some very auspicious income opportunities. 
       <h4>Love</h4> As you move into 2010 you are still in the process of receiving the biggest push start your love life has received with Jupiter, planet of luck making sure that by the time he leaves your romantic sector on the 18th January, that everything that needs to, should or can be put into motion is. Once Jupiter leaves he won’t return for another 12 years, but even when he does he will never again link up with Neptune and Chiron, the planets of dreams and healing here. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to put the past behind you and commit to your wildest romantic dreams. Venus, planet of love moves into your romantic sector on the 19th January, just a day after Jupiter leaves and along with the Sun and Mercury she’ll head a clean up squad, aimed at squeezing every possible romantic advantage from the ethers as possible. Once the 2nd March comes, your aim is to have everything on track, not just for the rest of the year but for years, if not decades to come. It’s from that point that your focus shifts to your relationships and the surprise twist that the heavens have in store for you this year. Normally a full year separates Jupiter’s departure from your romantic sector and his arrival into your relationship sector, giving you time to let things settle. But on the 6th June, just 5 ½ months later Jupiter will reach your relationship sector, well ahead of schedule and for the first time in 82 years, will join forces with Uranus, planet of surprise and the unexpected. It’s then that a major and I mean major relationship era begins, one that stretches out for the next 28 years. You must be in someone’s good books this year, for you have a lifetime of romantic and relationship advantages squeezed into one tiny year. 
       <h4>Money</h4> If 2010 is your lucky year for work opportunities, then the next question is going to be ‘where is the money’, for while it’s good to enjoy work success and to advance in new directions, there comes a point where you need to see the money and get the financial returns that you expect to go with it. While your work sector will be active for all but a few months in the middle of the year, the same is not true for events on the financial or income front. But it’s because there are isolated time frames where there is concentrated cosmic support, that allows you to strategise more effectively, mobilising your troops to the right battlefield at the right time, rather than spreading yourself thin throughout the year. Don’t focus too much on income opportunities until later in the year, putting either minimal or no time or effort into things, instead focus on getting things moving on the work front, knowing that in due course the income opportunities will flow. Address things on the financial front as a whole earlier in the year, with your financial sector active from the 1st April to the 10th June. With Mercury in your financial sector from the 3rd April to the 10th June and in retrograde motion from the 18th April to the 12th May, he’s the one most constant planet, giving you a chance to take a smart and logical approach to putting your financial situation on its most effective path. The focus doesn’t switch to your income opportunities until the 9th September, but as the old saying goes, when it rains it pours. It’s on the 9th September that Venus, planet of money, desire and the laws of attraction moves into your income sector. Normally here for around 4 weeks each year, this is always the most lucrative time of the year, when you’re more likely to attract income opportunities. Jupiter, planet of luck returns to your work sector on the 9th September, the very same day, creating a situation that was always going to open the doors to combined work and income opportunities. However, instead of the normal 4 weeks Venus will reach your income sector on the 9th September and remain until the 8th November, but then will return again on the 30th November, remaining until the 8th January 2011. With Jupiter not leaving your work sector on the 23rd January 2011 and Venus getting support that time from the Sun, Mercury and Mars, there isn’t a day from the 9th September onwards, that the road isn’t littered with income and work opportunities and advantages. 
       <h4>Career</h4> If a Libran was to ask me ‘what does 2010 hold for me’, I’d reply by saying that this is a very big year for work opportunities and while there are no signs of this in the first few days of the New Year, you won’t have to wait long to see what I mean. It’s on the 18th January that Jupiter, planet of luck moves into your work sector and here for all but 3 months of the year, this makes 2010 the luckiest year in a decade when it comes to work opportunities. Yet it goes beyond that and I see this as not being a once in a decade year for work opportunities and instead a once in a lifetime year. The reason I say that is because Uranus, planet of surprise and the unexpected has been in your work sector since 2003, where he has been slowly opening your mind to what’s possible and unlocking doors that you may not even be aware of. It’s when Jupiter and Uranus join forces in your work sector, something that hasn’t happened since 1928, that anything is possible. Uranus will leave your work sector on the 28th May but will return on the 14th August and Jupiter will leave on the 6th June, returning on the 9th September. While this brings huge opportunities this year, this is a gateway year with your work sector remaining active until 2019. It’s from the 12th February to the 21st March that you’re likely to find out just what kind of an impact this is going to have with two key dates to look out for. The first is on the 17th February and the second on the 16th March, both auspicious days for work opportunities and new beginnings. Meanwhile, conditions are strengthening on the career front, with a lunar eclipse in your career sector on New Years Day laying some very firm bottom lines in place, though it won’t be until mid year, when Uranus and Jupiter take a break from your work sector, that your focus will be more on your long term goals and on the next rung of the ladder.
