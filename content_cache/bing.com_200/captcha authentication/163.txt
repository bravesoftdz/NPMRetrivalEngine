   <h1>SSH for Java</h1> 
   <ul> 
    <li><p><strong>Java-SSH</strong> client by C&eacute;dric Gourio (free licence, Java source code). ssh protocol v. 1.5.<br> <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/software/java-ssh/">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fapp2/software/java-ssh/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>MindTerm</strong> client by Mindbright Technology AB (Mats Andersson). GNU General Public Licence through v. 1.21 (those releases now being almost impossible to find -- but see ISNetworks Java SSH/SCP Application/Applet, below), at which point Mindbright was bought by AppGate, and versions 2.0+ are now proprietary. Java source or bytecode. Also supports secure (SSH-tunnelled) passive-mode ftp. Supports scp. Can run as a Web-embedded applet, or standalone. Supports port-forwarding. Supports session-logging. Has a built-in RSA key-generator, useful with other SSH clients that lack ssh-keygen, such as TTSSH for Win32, Gordon Chaffee's SSH for Win32, etc. ssh protocol v. 1.5 (through v. 1.21), 2.0 protocol starting with the proprietary 2.0 version.<br> <a href="http://www.appgate.com/products/80_MindTerm/">http://www.appgate.com/products/80_MindTerm/</a><br> (formerly at http://www.mindbright.se/mindterm/)</p> </li> 
    <li><p> <strong>MindVNC</strong> by Mindbright Technology AB (Mats Andersson) Implements secure SSH-tunnelled) VNC-client sessions, as example of how MindTerm's ssh-package can be used to SSH-tunnel tcp-based protocols, generally. (Late versions of MindVNC were merged into the MindTerm package, possibly at the time that AppGate took MindTerm proprietary.) GNU General Public Licence. Java source or bytecode. ssh protocol v. 1.5.<br> <a href="http://www.docjar.com/src/api/mindbright/application/MindVNC.java">http://www.docjar.com/src/api/mindbright/application/MindVNC.java</a><br> (formerly at http://www.mindbright.se/english/technology/products/mindvnc.html)</p> </li> 
    <li><p> <strong>ISNetworks Java SSH/SCP Application/Applet</strong>, a fork from final GPLed release of Mindbright Technology AB's MindTerm client. Java source or bytecode. Also supports secure (SSH-tunnelled) passive-mode ftp. Supports scp. Can run as a Web-embedded applet, or standalone. Supports port-forwarding. Supports session-logging. Has a built-in RSA key-generator, useful with other SSH clients that lack ssh-keygen, such as TTSSH for Win32, Gordon Chaffee's SSH for Win32, etc. ssh protocol v. 1.5.<br> <a href="http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/hobbes/java/apps/isnetworksmindterm1.2.1scp3.zip">http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/hobbes/java/apps/isnetworksmindterm1.2.1scp3.zip</a><br> <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/java/">http://linuxmafia.com/pub/java/</a><br> (Formerly at http://www.isnetworks.com/ssh/.)</p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>JCTerm</strong> by Atsuhiko Yamanaka (JCraft, Inc.) is an SSH2 Java terminal emulator, with sftp and port forwarding. Supports SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy. Java source code or Java bytecode under the GNU GPL. ssh protocol v. 2.0.<br> <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/">http://www.jcraft.com/jcterm/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>JSch</strong> by Atsuhiko Yamanaka is a pure Java implementation of SSH2, with port forwarding, X11 forwarding, file transfer, etc., and the ability to be integrated into Java programs. Java source code or Java bytecode under the BSD licence. ssh protocol v. 2.0<br> <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>JSSH</strong> by Rob Pitman is a Java class library to implement SSH in larger Java codebases. Derived from C&eacute;dric Gourio's Java-SSH client and from Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Mei&szlig;ner's Java Telnet/ SSH Applet. Java source code or Java bytecode under the GNU GPL. ssh protocol v. 1.5.<br> <a href="http://www.pitman.co.za/projects/jssh/">http://www.pitman.co.za/projects/jssh/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>Ganymed SSH-2 for Java</strong> by Christian Plattner (Cleondris, Switzerland) is a class library implementing SSH2 in pure Java. It supports SSH sessions (remote command execution and shell access), local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, scp, and sftp. There are no dependencies on any JCE (Java Crypto Extension) provider, as all crypto functionality is included. It was used, earlier, in the Ganymed replication project and a couple of other projects at ETH Zurich. Earlier versions of the code were available for download from Trilead AG as Trilead SSH-2 for Java. Java source code and Java bytecode under a BSD-style licence. ssh protocol v. 2.0<br> <a href="http://www.cleondris.ch/ssh2/">http://www.cleondris.ch/ssh2/</a><br> <a href="http://www.ganymed.ethz.ch/ssh2/">http://www.ganymed.ethz.ch/ssh2/</a> (older versions; deprecated) </p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>JTA</strong> = Java Telnet/SSH Applet by Matthias L. Jugel and Marcus Mei&szlig;ner is a telnet and SSH client with vt320/vt220/vt100 and ANSI terminal support. Based on C&eacute;dric Gourio's Java-SSH. Java source code or Java bytecode under the GNU GPL. ssh protocol v. 1.5.<br> <a href="http://javassh.org/">http://javassh.org/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p> <strong>SSHTools</strong> by Lee David Painter and Richard Pernavas is a suite of tools including a plug-in SSH2 library, an SSH client, an sftp client, an SSH-wrapped VNC client, and an SSH daemon. C++ and Java source code or Java bytecode and Linux or Win32 binaries under the GNU GPL. ssh protocol v. 2.0.<br> <a href="http://www.sshtools.com/">http://www.sshtools.com/</a></p> </li> 
    <li><p><strong>Jaramiko</strong> is a port of Paramiko (which, please see in the Unix category) to pure Java 1.3 or later. Does not (as of 2006-06) support sftp, generation of RSA keys, or exchange of group-exchange keys. Java source code under the MIT/X11 licence. ssh protocol v. 2.0 only.<br> <a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/java/">http://www.lag.net/paramiko/java/</a></p> </li>
